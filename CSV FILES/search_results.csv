Growing up on the fringes of Silicon Valley with a mathematical and entrepreneurial mind, Tony founded in his garage, grew, and sold several technology start-ups during the dot-com years, ultimately founding Solera in 2005. Solera is an automotive technology company, that Tony founded with GTCR as his capital partner. Under his leadership as Founder, Chairman and CEO, the company went public through a $1 billion initial public offering in 2007 and private again in 2016, at a valuation of $6.5 billion. Significantly growing the total addressable market by executing over 50 acquisitions during his tenure, it employed 7,000 people in more than 90 countries. In 2019, based on his proven track record of 70+ transactions with $15bn+ in aggregate value and an industry leading return profile, Tony founded AFV Partners LLC, a long-term sustainable capital vehicle that invests globally in assets that contribute to a net positive impact on the environment. Canoo is currently one of AFV’s significant investments. Tony initially agreed to provide rescue capital to the company in July 2020. This was followed by his participation in the PIPE. His investments in Canoo were based on his assessment of the company’s competitive advantage: its industry unique focus on proprietary engineering and technology. In preparations for the SPAC merger, Tony was asked to join the board and, effective with the completion of the merger and de-SPAC with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV in December 2020, became its Chairman. In April 2021, in the midst of maturing pains as a public company and the increased market scrutiny of SPAC businesses, particularly in the EV space, Tony accepted the CEO position, based on his deep belief in the design and engineering team, to accelerate the transformation of the business to set it apart from the herd. Since that time, Canoo expanded the executive team, announced three new vehicle trims, a Phase 1 advanced industrialization facility and established a landmark partnership for a Phase 2 owned mega-micro manufacturing facility on tribal land in Pryor, Oklahoma. Under Tony’s leadership the business grew to more than 700 engineers across five locations. He and his team are committed to their mission to bring EVs to everyone. As part of the re-founding, Tony and the team have a “relentless and uncompromising” approach to innovation and are set to bring sustainable and purpose driven EVs to the hard-working people of the heartlands and beyond. He has a disciplined approach to “thinking differently” and he’s deeply rooted in his reverence for nature, affordable mobility for everyone, and helping businesses and teams succeed to make a lasting difference in the world. On February 22, 2022, Tony was appointed by Governor Hutchinson to the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility, which includes representatives from Walmart, J.B. Hunt, the Arkansas Trucking and Auto Dealers Associations, the University of Arkansas and Southern Arkansas University Tech, and several state agencies, among others. The Council on Future Mobility has a goal to capitalize on advancements in mobility and further cement Arkansas as a national and global leader in the sector.

Technologies (NASDAQ: GOEV ) announced today that it has established an agreement with the Pawnee Nation, based in Pawnee, Oklahoma , to identify and nurture emerging business and job opportunities in

""Our decision to locate our manufacturing in Oklahoma was driven in part by opportunities to work with tribal nations and others to further diversify local economies and to help create good jobs for working people in a dynamic emerging industry,"" says Tony Aquila, Chairman and CEO, Canoo.  ""Under this agreement, the Pawnee Nation and Canoo will work together to train workers and develop suppliers for Oklahoma's growing clean energy industry."" ""We are excited to partner with Canoo and to continue to expand our business and economic development ventures,"" said Pawnee Nation President Misty M. Nuttle .  ""This partnership brings diversification for us as we engage in industries we currently have not explored. We are enlivened to be on the frontier of energy and renewable energy opportunities and as stewards of our tribal and trust lands and natural resources, felt it is our duty to engage in the most responsible efforts and initiatives, so our resources remain available for future generations. We felt Canoo, through their knowledge and experience within the clean energy industry, shared this same vision. Their willingness to assist the Nation in enhancing our efforts to meet the needs of people has shown us that we are embarking on a true partnership."" The agreement between the Pawnee Nation and Canoo is focused on four areas, Aquila says. First, building workforce skills in zero-emission vehicles and other clean energy technologies. Second, developing qualified suppliers of parts and services needed for the zero-emission vehicle industry. Third, supporting STEM education by connecting Pawnee students to internships and employment opportunities in clean energy fields. And finally, the Pawnee Nation will place an initial order for Canoo vehicles that will be built in Oklahoma . Pawnee Business Council Vice President, Jordan Kanuho said about the partnership with Canoo, ""The Pawnee Nation believes that partnerships are key to tackling the challenges we face when it comes to issues such as climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion within the workforce, education, and training.  Through recent partnerships with our Pawnee Nation Infrastructure Taskforce professionals and organizations such as Tribuquent, the University of Oklahoma , and the Pawnee Nation College, we have begun exploring innovative ways to repurpose oil wells on our lands for the use of geothermal energy along with photovoltaic technologies to produce clean energy on our tribal lands."" Canoo said it believes this agreement is the first-of-its-kind with the Pawnee Nation and any business involved in clean tech or clean energy, such as manufacturing electric vehicles. The Pawnee Nation is focused on the continued development of its alternative fuel energy strategy and shift toward electrification within its community. Kanuho added, ""This exciting partnership with Canoo will build on the work we're currently doing in clean energy while at the same time, offering great opportunities to our tribal citizens in the area of workforce development, supporting STEM, and inspiring the next generation of Pawnee scientists and engineers by connecting students to internships, apprenticeships, and employment opportunities in clean energy technology fields.  We see that Canoo is doing some amazing things in the clean energy sector, and we're excited to partner with them in this wonderful opportunity"".

Terms of Service Privacy Policy Newsroom View all articles View all articles Media Article May 19, 2020 Written by Routable AI Names Ex-Uber/Canoo Exec James Cox as Chief Operating Officer CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Routable AI , an on-demand vehicle routing and management platform today announced it recently appointed James Cox as its Chief Operating Officer. Cox will lead the Company’s product rollout and growth strategies as it targets on-demand bus, shuttle, ride-sharing, and micro-mobility markets as the industry adjusts to post-COVID-19 activity. Cox most recently served as the Chief Product Officer at Canoo, a Los Angeles-based subscription company for electric cars. During his tenure, Cox re-shaped market strategy to be compatible with a shared, autonomous, electric future, and successfully garnered thousands of new users for the company. Cox built the customer experience, including the consumer website and app, while launching a gamified, free and viral waitlist unique to the auto industry. Prior to Canoo, Cox served in a variety of senior product roles at Uber, including his most recent as Global Head of Rider App Product Operations. Cox’s tenure at Uber included leadership of the global rollout of uberPOOL to 41 cities within the USA, China, India, and Europe. As the eighth employee at Uber Australia, he helped launch uberX in Sydney, growing the service to 250,000 trips per week. “I’m thrilled to be joining Routable AI at a critical time for the ridesharing and public transport industries. High capacity pooling is not a solved problem. As a startup, Routable AI developed a unique and powerful algorithm over five years of research. It doesn’t make sense for every transit agency and ride-sharing company to try to build the same technology internally,” said Cox. “The industry is ripe for innovation right now, and I’m excited to work with Menno van der Zee, Alex Wallar, and the entire Routable AI team as we disrupt high-capacity pooling with our powerful platform.” Cox joins Routable AI at a time of uncertainty and opportunity within the global ridesharing industry following the COVID-19 pandemic. As individual ridesharing trips decline drastically in cities hit hard by the virus, and local transportation authorities place heavy restrictions or shutdown orders on public transportation, all involved must identify a safe and efficient way to transport people as cities begin to reopen. “We’re both excited and fortunate to have an industry veteran like James Cox join the Routable AI team. His pedigree speaks for itself, having led many high-profile product rollouts at Uber and Canoo, while successfully accelerating user growth,” said Menno van der Zee, co-founder and CEO, Routable AI. “As the industry rebounds from COVID-19, we believe we have a unique opportunity to provide immediate value for ridesharing companies, public transit authorities, and others in need of an efficient fleet management solution, as they look to safely return to the road and serve their communities.” Routable AI’s technology is an ideal solution for enabling high-capacity ridesharing on demand, including city shuttle and bus services. The platform enables an efficient and cost-effective way to transport citizens without crowded mass transportation or exponentially more cars on the road serving individual riders. “We’ve seen a complete openness from government and city agencies to embrace technology to improve public transportation, but that technology is also extremely hard to develop. That’s where we come in – our solution can be integrated quickly to help transit agencies get fleets of shuttles and buses running on-demand in place of shut down or restricted public transportation,” said Alex Wallar, co-founder and CTO, Routable AI. “As cities return to a new normal following COVID-19, it will be critical to ensure safe and reliable transportation for citizens using methods like capacity limitation and more optimized uses of shuttle and bus fleets. Routable AI is here to make that a reality.” Routable AI is currently working with multiple entities across the globe, including a ridesharing shuttle service in South-East Asia, a shared rides shuttle app in Germany, and one of the largest Chinese ride-sharing companies. They are also in discussions with several U.S. mass transit authorities to help agencies simulate and model what changes will be required to fleets and to identify ways Routable AI’s fleet management solutions can help cities reopen their roadways to travelers. About Routable AI Routable AI is an MIT-born startup developing on-demand vehicle routing solutions for high capacity ride sharing within cars, shuttles, and buses. Routable AI’s end-to-end solution targets the high-capacity mobility-as-a-service market with low-cost, highly efficient, and ultra-convenient transportation options for on-demand bus, shuttle, ride-sharing, and micro-mobility markets. The company’s patent-pending routing algorithms and AI offer a 10X advantage over current routing methodologies and have been shown to reduce fleet sizes by as much as 80% due to more efficient routing and optimization.

Canoo said a year ago that it intended to provide at least 1,500 jobs by building a factory with 3-million-plus square feet of space at MAIP. Company CEO Tony Aquila said earlier this year that a plant capable of producing 300,000 vehicles annually could be operational in Pryor by 2024. “It is in delay mode, but that’s for a number of reasons,” MAIP Chief Administrative Officer David Stewart said Thursday before a regular meeting of the Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority, which operates the industrial park.

The stock market is challenged at best,” he continued. “Supply-chain issues are big, as they are with all companies, but especially with a start-up that has a new product. Canoo’s goal is to have this 100% made in the U.S., so that is also delaying the project. “Finally, construction costs are through the roof. So the right financial decision is to wait until these supply-chain issues and construction costs go down and the construction labor market builds.” Stewart said he’s had light conversations about these issues with Canoo. “There’s nothing that tells me that Canoo is not going to survive all this,” he said Thursday. But last month, Canoo reported first-quarter losses of $125.4 million, casting “substantial doubt” on its ability to move forward as a company in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Aquila has said the state of Oklahoma has committed about $300 million in nondiluted financial incentives to support the proposed Oklahoma facility, for which some ground has been cleared for construction. Canoo set up its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it wants to build an advanced manufacturing facility that could be operational late this year or early in 2023. “If you give the construction and supply-chain issues six to nine months, I would say that’s reasonable in my estimation,” Stewart said. “If your goal is to be 100%-American and you can’t get American parts, that’s kind of hard to fill that goal. It’s understandable. It makes sense in my mind from a business point of view that there will be a delay in production. “My understanding is that the cars are still being built, and Bentonville is still underway. So we are the tail end of the process for building the car in mass production. Because of our position in that cycle, it’s understandable that we would feel the effect of all of those issues compounded.” Stewart said Thursday that he also believes MAIP remains in contention for Project Ocean, widely reported to be an at least $3 billion electric battery plant for which Panasonic is seeking new operations in either Kansas or Oklahoma. It is unclear when Panasonic will make a decision. “We are not assuming they are not coming,” Stewart said. “We are going to go full force and do what we do to show Ocean that this is a great place to be.” Court challenges were filed this week protesting the legal sufficiency of a referendum petition that asked that a $300 million tax increment financing district go to a vote of the people. Approved by Mayes County commissioners in April, the 12-year TIF would encompass 588 acres inside MAIP to back initiatives such as Project Ocean. The challenges could be heard in mid-July, though a court date hasn’t been set, an assistant district attorney said. If the petition survives the challenges, it could be placed on the November ballot. “The fact that we have a couple of thousand people that want to take this to a vote does not mean that the public does not want it, and it doesn’t mean it’s not what the communities want,” Stewart said. “It’s democracy at its finest. They are following the process. “But we are not letting this slow us down in our effort to follow the path that we’ve been following. And that is getting the communities ready, getting the workforce ready and getting the land ready.” In addition to the proposed Mayes County incentive, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill this spring to provide the firm with up to $698 million in rebates based on capital investment and job creation.

Jennifer Ramsay Electric carmaker Canoo will shift from  R&D to focus more on manufacturing in 2023, hoping to further slash operating expenses following a 45% reduction last year, CEO Tony Aquila said. Executives  expect operating expenses to be between $55 and  $70 million and capital expenditures between $30 and $45 million, both reductions  from 2022 goals. “Migrating from an R&D design and premarket delivery to  a manufacturing and market launch organization hitting these milestones will  better help us manage the current market turbulence,” he said. Ramping up production in 2023 means hitting a 20,000-unit run  rate at its Oklahoma City factory, a number executives have held firm on since  Q3. Canoo currently has a $2.8 billion order book, including 4,500 vans to be  used as Walmart delivery vehicles. Aquila’s  affirmation of Canoo’s production target stands in contrast with Arrival,  another EV commercial vehicle startup, which had to dial  back its ambitions over the past year (On a related note, General Motors Corp.'s  BrightDrop division will this year deliver the first 200 of 4,000 electric vans  to Ryder System Inc.). But Canoo still has work to do: When asked about the current  level of preparedness, Aquila said they were in the “65%-ish range of items on  the ground, probably at north of 85% with what's inbound,” although they’d  found a workflow that supported their confidence in achieving it. Canoo announced its Q4 results on  March 30, which showed it failed to generate any revenue in the quarter and  experienced a comprehensive loss of $82 million, compared to $138.1 million in  Q4 2021, and $487.7 million for the year, compared to $346.8 million last year.  The company posted a going concern at the end of Q1, as it lost $125 million in  the period and had less than that in cash left. Q4 also saw Canoo settle the  SEC investigation into whether former senior executives had misled investors,  and the company will pay a $1.5 million fine as result. Despite the lows of the year,  executives remained optimistic about the big picture. They delivered Canoo’s first  light tactical vehicle (LTV) to the U.S. Army and entered a partnership with a  Saudi Arabian distribution company. With the investigation wrapped up, Aquila said Canoo can now apply for government programs such as the “Department of Energy loan program and  things of that nature.” After  reporting earnings, Canoo stock (Ticker: GOEV) fell from trading at $0.62 per  share to $0.60 the following day, although it ended up rising to $0.69 that  same day. Over the past six months, they have continued a general downward  trend, currently trading 66% lower than the Oct. 2022 high.

the industry in which Canoo operates,https://www.3ds.com/insights/customer-stories/canoo,CANOO | Customer Story - Dassault Systèmes,"CANOO | Customer Story - Dassault Systèmes 3DS 3DS Insights Customer Stories CANOO Customer Stories CANOO Canoo needed a cloud-based digital collaboration platform to facilitate the work of design and engineering experts and to devote more resources to competitive product development. Watch the video Download the case study EV startup designs vehicle for new models of mobility Think of everything you’ve ever known about cars: their physical design, their ownership model, and how they spend most of their time parked. Now, haul those ideas to the junkyard and make way for something new: electric vehicles (EV) for subscription. The California start-up Canoo is reimagining not just what a vehicle is, but also the business model for how it steers its way to drivers’ hands. The buy-or-lease vehicle ownership model prevalent today leaves drivers responsible for burdensome capital outlays, insurance and maintenance. Canoo’s EV by subscription will be both environmentally and financially more sustainable. “We don’t want to be just another electric car company that produces a car and sells it through dealerships; that’s not the business model of the future,” said Stefan Krause, co-founder and chairman of the Advisory Board at Canoo, who will target megacities starting in the US. “Many people don’t want to be bothered by having to register a car, maintain a car, sell a used car. They want to make a monthly payment and have all their transportation needs covered – and we’re creating a car that enables this.” To fulfill that vision – and an ambitious go-to-market target of 2021 – Canoo relies on Dassault Systèmes’ 3D EXPERIENCE® platform on the cloud as its global collaboration platform for digital design and engineering. “We’ve used 3D EXPERIENCE on the cloud ever since we started up in a garage [in 2017],” Krause said. “With our time-to-market goals, we didn’t have six months to get back-end computers to work. The cloud-based system has been fantastic, and it’s worked seamlessly for us through multiple moves and expansions. You put your computer on the table and you’re immediately able to collaborate efficiently around the world. If you create innovation, you need your digital platform to work. In the end, I can really say that Dassault Systèmes’ 3D EXPERIENCE platform is a super good platform to create these types of innovations that we are working on. Stefan Krause Co-founder and chairman of the Advisory Board, Canoo Meaningful purpose A former BMW and Deutsche Bank executive, Krause had plenty of time sitting in Los Angeles traffic to think about better ways to provide mobility. He saw more and more cars taxing a road infrastructure that, without routing optimization, was inefficiently used. He saw cars, which spend 90% of their time parked, as underutilized capital investments. And, while electric drive had started to address emission concerns, the industry remained wedded to old design paradigms. Krause knew that big companies, stuck in the formulas that gave rise to their success, tend to avoid entrepreneurial risk. He formed Canoo with another former BMW executive, Ulrich Kranz, and attracted an executive team of like-minded visionaries. “We have a different culture because people who work at Canoo come here because they like the purpose,” he said. “I like cars and I also like to solve problems faced by humanity. To work at the forefront of technology for a meaningful purpose is inspiring.” The vehicle can hold up to seven people but the exterior footprint is the size of a compact car. Unleashing design innovations A distinguishing Canoo design innovation is its proprietary skateboard architecture in which different vehicle ‘form factors’ sit on top of a common underbody that stores the batteries and electric drivetrain. Stepping away from the traditional three-box vehicle design of engine in front, occupants in the middle and luggage in the back, opens room for Canoo to configure the cabin space as a private car, a rideshare or delivery vehicle— or perhaps something else. “We are breaking free of that three-box design, to have open space on top of the skateboard,” said Alexi Charbonneau, who is in charge of skateboard and cabin of Canoo vehicles. “We have a ‘loft’ on wheels that we can customize as the user wants.” The vehicle can hold up to seven people but the exterior footprint is the size of a compact car. In addition, they’re autonomous-ready and equipped with intelligence to optimize traffic routing. Also on Charbonneau’s innovation agenda is to rethink vehicle silhouettes. “It wasn’t done before because it’s really easy to follow the traditional silhouette of a vehicle, and not be too disruptive,” he said. Designing on the cloud improves time to market. There are no more files to be exchanged with suppliers, so we can work in the same database. Alexi Charbonneau In charge of skateboard and cabin, Canoo Cloud enabling global collaboration Canoo started with five users on the 3D EXPERIENCE platform on the cloud, thinking it might have to move to an on-premises deployment when the number of users reached 30. Not so. Today, Canoo easily supports more than 150 users worldwide on the cloud. “It is a huge relief not to have to manage servers or infrastructure,” said Matt Sommer, in charge of methods at Canoo. “The cloud model also simplifies license management while keeping us on the cutting edge of technology upgrades.” The solution scales well, he added, with simple onboarding of additional collaborators. “One of the things l love about 3D EXPERIENCE is how easy it is to add new users,” Sommer said. “They simply log onto the platform and install the media.” With fewer resources dedicated to the IT infrastructure and backend systems, Canoo can focus on product development and interaction among the engineers. “We can have collaborative design, where our internal users model and change designs, and then our vendors and contractors can see those alterations in real time,” Sommer said. “We don’t have to manage a file system or where people store their data. They save it into the cloud and people can see it immediately.” Canoo’s biggest innovation challenge is to quickly combine diverse design and engineering disciplines provided by experts around the world, says Charbonneau. “The main benefit of concurrent design and engineering is to leverage expertise that resides in different companies, or on different continents, and have them all feed into one product,” Charbonneau said. “Designing on the cloud improves time to market. There are no more files to be exchanged with suppliers, so we can work in the same database.” To save additional time, Canoo also leveraged the platform’s SFE technology supporting body conceptual engineering, performance evaluation, and optimization for the transportation and mobility industry. “SFE helped us create the computer-aided engineering (CAE) model upfront without computer-aided design (CAD) data,” Charbonneau said. “Within two weeks, we had a full vehicle model up and running. After six months, we synced the two, and the CAD drove the CAE in terms of refinement. We gained a lot of development speed by going straight from the CAE to the CAD, and not the traditional CAD leading the CAE.” In its creative use of 3DEXPERIENCE, Canoo drew on expert support from Dassault Systèmes Value Solution Partner XD Innovation. “They have local resources and it’s fantastic to have them come by for face-to-face support,” said Sommer. A distinguishing Canoo design innovation is its proprietary skateboard architecture in which different vehicle form factors sit on top of a common underbody that stores thebatteries and electric drivetrain. Innovative goals Leveraging the design, engineering and collaboration power of the 3D EXPERIENCE platform, Canoo is on track to revolutionize how people think about, acquire, drive and pay for vehicles. “A car purpose-built for subscription needs to be quite different from a car purpose-built to sell to you. We’re building the car that enables this type of business model,” Krause said. “You’re still going to drive from A to B, and one day the car is going to drive itself from A to B with you inside. But we will have a very different relationship to mobility. You pay a monthly fee and Canoo will take care of everything. It will be seamless. We will liberate you from the inconveniences of vehicle ownership.” Krause gives credit to its product innovation platform to support Canoo’s unique goals. “If you create innovation, you need your digital platform to work. In the end, I can really say that Dassault Systèmes’ 3D EXPERIENCE platform is a super good platform to create these types of innovations that we are working on.” Focus on Canoo Canoo is a California company creating electric vehicles (EV) made for subscription.

The EV company Canoo is setting up shop with yet another facility, this time, in Oklahoma City. (KOKH) OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) — The push to bring the electric vehicle industry to Oklahoma has made another stride. The EV company Canoo is setting up shop with yet another facility, this time, in Oklahoma City. Canoo asked the State Department of Commerce to keep the location a secret. The deal hasn't closed yet, but the real estate agent told FOX25 the property of the future Canoo facility is the old Terex building in west OKC, near I-40 and Morgan Road. While Oklahoma has been successful in oil and gas, the Governor is hoping to add electric to the energy portfolio.

Formerly Evelozcity (2017–2019) Company type Public Traded as Nasdaq : GOEV Russell 2000 component Industry Automotive Founded 2017 ; 7 years ago ( 2017 ) Founders Stefan Krause Ulrich Kranz Headquarters Torrance, California , US , U.S. [1] Key people Tony Aquila ( chairman & CEO ) Products Electric vehicles Number of employees 805 (December 31, 2021) Website www .canoo .com Canoo Inc. is an American automotive company based in Torrance, California , that develops and manufactures electric vehicles . [2] [3] Canoo's research & development team is based in Michigan , in the Detroit region ( Auburn Hills , Livonia ), and production operations are in Justin, Texas . The company also plans to produce commercial electric vehicles such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services. [4] History [ edit ] Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name Evelozcity by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for Deutsche Bank as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for BMW as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company Faraday Future before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became chief technology officer . [5] The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan and German entrepreneur David Stern. [6] [7] In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of Opel as a senior executive. [8] In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo. [9] In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company. [10] Canoo Lifestyle Vehicles , all-electric minivans Main articles: Canoo LV and Canoo MPDV In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle . [11] In February 2020, Hyundai Motor Group , the parent company of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors , announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's Strategy 2025 program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020. [12] [13] [14] In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure. [15] [16] In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program Jay Leno's Garage . [17] In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the NASDAQ valued at $2.4 billion. [18] The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022. [19] [20] On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV. [21] A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023. [22] In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project . [23] [24] In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter. [25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly. [26] In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business, [27] [28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors. [29] Corporate changes [ edit ] On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck , an electric pickup set to release in 2023. [30] [31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque. [30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity. [30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%. [31] It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles. [32] On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO. [33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders. [34] On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa ) to manufacture all of their future vehicles. [35] [36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023."" [36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market. [37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement. [38] On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there. [39] As of December 2022 [update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters. [1] [40] In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing. [41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production. Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma. [42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year. [43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor. [44] In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs. [45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex . [46] Firm orders [ edit ] On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program , with a total contract value of $147,855. [47] [48] In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future. [49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice. [50] Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles , ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024. [51] [52] [53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order. [54] [55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health. [56] In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans. [57] [58] [59] References [ edit ] ^ a b ""Canoo Investor Relations"" . investors.canoo.com .
