Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million. Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about one-third from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020. About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars. Numerous factors contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis. Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets. Europe Overall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands. This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the European Union’s CO 2 emissions standards that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European governments increased subsidy schemes for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic. In European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%). China The overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%. Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered. Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic, several cities relaxed car licence policies , allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries. United States The US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations, reaching their limit . Other countries Electric car markets in other countries were resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000. New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown. Another exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share. Consumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises Consumer spending Consumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV. Government spending Governments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020. All the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many countries responded to the pandemic -induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened. An important novelty in subsidy schemes was the introduction of price caps in Europe and China , i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper. Consumer and government spending on electric cars, 2015-2020 Open expand More electric car models are available; ranges start to plateau Electric car models available globally and average range, 2015-2020 Open expand Electric car models available by region, 2020 Open expand Automakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models Worldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled. BEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level. The average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years. The widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons: SUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States. SUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car. Electrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles goes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car. In Europe, the ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO 2 emissions standards offers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO 2 emissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market. China leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market Global electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader. Electric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%. In Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by CO 2 standards that limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars. Registration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs. The explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about air pollution , particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced plans to electrify delivery fleets . Electric LCVs registrations by region, 2015-2020 Open expand 18 of the 20 largest OEMs have committed to increase the offer and sales of EVs Original equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles Open expand Original equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles Close dialog Download image Download image Sources BMW (2021); BJEV-BAIC (2021); BYD (2021); Chery (2021); Changan Automobile (2021); Daimler (2021); Dongfeng (2021); FAW (2021); Ford (2021); GAC; General Motors; Honda (2021); Hyundai (2020); Mazda (2021); Renault-Nissan (2019); Maruti Suzuki (2019); SAIC (2021); Stellantis (2021); Toyota (2021); Volkswagen (2021). Notes This table is based on the authors’ understanding of OEM announcements and may not be complete. It includes only announcements related to electric 
light-duty vehicles (PHEVs and BEVs) and it excludes announcements related to hybrid vehicles and those that do not provide a clear indication of the EV share. Manufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario OEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs). A number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond previous announcements related to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond. Significantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included: Volvo will only sell electric cars from 2030 ; Ford will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030 ; General Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035 ; Volkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030 ; and Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States . Overall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV projections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario . By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario. OEMs’ announcements compared to electric LDVs stock projections, 2021-2025 Open expand Trends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles Electric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020 Electric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000. Bus registrations China continues to dominate the electric bus market , with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force. Electric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding European Clean Bus Deployment Initiative and demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies. In North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020. Heavy-duty truck registrations Global electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both. Electric  truck registrations by region, 2015-2020 Open expand Electric bus registrations by region, 2015-2020 Open expand Electric heavy-duty vehicle models are broadening The availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets. 1 Buses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations. The growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as Daimler , MAN , Renault , Scania and Volvo have indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs. The HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.

Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative update on private sector commitments Despite a turbulent year, major companies around the world are accelerating the transition to electric mobility by shifting fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging stations. The Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative brings together over 100 companies in 80 markets committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030. Collectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks. EV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations. Significant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. To help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. Top 5 barriers to EV adoption reported by EV100 member companies Open expand Battery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand Automotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity. China accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh. Nickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market. According to the BNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices, the weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by teardown analysis of a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells. In Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but announced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025 . Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the European Investment Bank . In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large investments in a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture. Battery demand by region, 2015-2020 Open expand Battery demand by mode, 2015-2020 Open expand Pandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility Electric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility. Sales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled in 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%. Many shared micromobility operators reduced or suspended services during the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with 270 cities worldwide relaunching operations . As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020. Preliminary data from operators indicate average trip distances on e-scooters have increased by around 25% relative to before the pandemic . Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to expand into electric mopeds , which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit. Several major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of swappable batteries increases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles. Privately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives. Availability of dockless shared micromobility services in Europe and Central Asia, 2019-2021 Open expand Korea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs. To address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks. In 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks. In 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020.

Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers. Slow chargers The pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers. Europe is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020. Installation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place. Fast chargers The pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment. In Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers. Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle. Most countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive (AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries. AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020. In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy. Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can largely use private home charging . To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark. Ratio of public chargers per EV stock by country, 2020 Open expand Planning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020. HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate standardisation . Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the high power requirements of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed. Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an ultra-high power charging standard (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative established a task force called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the combined charging system (CCS) standard . Prototype testing started in September 2020 . Tesla announced in late 2020 that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN. Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs. There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with stimulus funding , Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an open-access test centre for companies and academia that offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.

From generous government subsidies to support for lithium batteries, here are the keys to understanding how China managed to build a world-leading industry in electric vehicles. By Zeyi Yang archive page February 21, 2023 Annu Kilpelainen Tech Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more here . Curio · MIT Technology Review | How did China come to dominate the world of electric cars? Before most people could realize the extent of what was happening, China became a world leader in making and buying EVs. And the momentum hasn’t slowed: In just the past two years, the number of EVs sold annually in the country grew from 1.3 million to a whopping 6.8 million , making 2022 the eighth consecutive year in which China was the world’s largest market for EVs. For comparison, the US only sold about 800,000 EVs in 2022. The industry is growing at a speed that has surprised even the most experienced observers: “The forecasts are always too low,” says Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a business consulting firm that specializes in transportation. This dominance in the EV sector has not only given China’s auto industry sustained growth during the pandemic but boosted China in its quest to become one of the world’s leaders in climate policy. How exactly did China manage to pull this off? Several experts tell MIT Technology Review that the government has long played an important role—propping up both the supply of EVs and the demand for them. As a result of generous government subsidies, tax breaks, procurement contracts, and other policy incentives, a slew of homegrown EV brands have emerged and continued to optimize new technologies so they can meet the real-life needs of Chinese consumers. This in turn has cultivated a large group of young car buyers. But the story of how the sector got here is about more than just Chinese state policy; it also includes Tesla, Chinese battery tech researchers, and consumers across the rest of Asia. When did China start investing in EVs and why? In the early 2000s, before it fully ventured into the field of EVs, China’s car industry was in an awkward position. It was a powerhouse in manufacturing traditional internal-combustion cars, but there were no domestic brands that could one day rival the foreign makers dominating this market. “They realized … that they would never overtake the US, German, and Japanese legacy automakers on internal-combustion engine innovation,” says Tu. And research on hybrid vehicles, whose batteries in the early years served a secondary role relative to the gas engine, was already being led by countries like Japan, meaning China also couldn’t really compete there either. This pushed the Chinese government to break away from the established technology and invest in completely new territory: cars powered entirely by batteries. The risks were extremely high; at this point, EVs were only niche experiments made by brands like General Motors or Toyota, which usually discontinued them after just a few years. But the potential reward was a big one: an edge for China in what could be a significant slice of the auto industry. Related Story Why EVs won’t replace hybrid cars anytime soon Plug-in hybrids won’t get the world to zero emissions, but they can help cut climate impacts somewhat. Toyota is betting they’ll stay in the mix for a while. Meanwhile, countries that excelled in producing gas or hybrid cars had less incentive to pursue new types of vehicles. With hybrids, for instance, “[Japan] was already standing at the peak, so it failed to see why it needed to electrify [the auto industry]: I can already produce cars that are 40% more energy efficient than yours. It will take a long time for you to even catch up with me ,” says He Hui, senior policy analyst and China regional co-lead at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), a nonprofit think tank. Plus, for China, EVs also had the potential to solve several other major problems, like curbing its severe air pollution, reducing its reliance on imported oil, and helping to rebuild the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It seemed like a win-win for Beijing. China already had some structural advantages in place. While EV manufacturing involves a different technology, it still requires the cooperation of the existing auto supply chain, and China had a relatively good one. The manufacturing capabilities and cheap commodities that sustained its gas-car factories could also be shifted to support a nascent EV industry. So the Chinese government took steps to invest in related technologies as early as 2001; that year, EV technology was introduced as a priority science research project in China’s Five-Year Plan, the country’s highest-level economic blueprint. Then, in 2007, the industry got a significant boost when Wan Gang, an auto engineer who had worked for Audi in Germany for a decade, became China’s minister of science and technology. Wan had been a big fan of EVs and tested Tesla’s first EV model, the Roadster, in 2008, the year it was released. People now credit Wan with making the national decision to go all-in on electric vehicles. Since then, EV development has been consistently prioritized in China’s national economic planning. So what exactly did the government do? It’s ingrained in the nature of the country’s economic system: the Chinese government is very good at focusing resources on the industries it wants to grow. It has been doing the same for semiconductors recently. Starting in 2009, the country began handing out financial subsidies to EV companies for producing buses, taxis, or cars for individual consumers. That year, fewer than 500 EVs were sold in China. But more money meant companies could keep spending to improve their models. It also meant consumers could spend less to get an EV of their own. From 2009 to 2022, the government poured over 200 billion RMB ($29 billion) into relevant subsidies and tax breaks. While the subsidy policy officially ended at the end of last year and was replaced by a more market-oriented system called “ dual credits ,” it had already had its intended effect: the more than 6 million EVs sold in China in 2022 accounted for over half of global EV sales . The government also helped domestic EV companies stay afloat in their early years by handing out procurement contracts. Around 2010, before the consumer market accepted EVs, the first ones in China were part of its vast public transportation system. “China has millions of public transits, buses, taxis, etc. They provided reliable contracts for lots of vehicles, so that kind of provided a revenue stream,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “In addition to the financial element, it also provided a lot of [road test] data for these companies.” But subsidies and tax breaks are still not the whole picture; there were yet other state policies that encouraged individuals to purchase EVs. In populous cities like Beijing, car license plates have been rationed for more than a decade, and it can still take years or thousands of dollars to get one for a gas car. But the process was basically waived for people who decided to purchase an EV. Finally, local governments have also sometimes worked closely with EV companies to customize policies that can help the latter grow. For example, BYD, the Chinese company currently challenging Tesla’s dominance in EV s, rose up by keeping a close relationship with the southern city of Shenzhen and making it the first city in the world to completely electrify its public bus fleet. Okay, so China is the global EV leader. But how does Tesla, the most popular individual producer of EVs, fit in? The development of China’s EV industry has actually been deeply intertwined with Tesla’s rise as the biggest EV company. When the Chinese government handed out subsidies, it didn’t limit them to domestic companies. “In my opinion, this was very smart,” says Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, an investment management firm. “Rather than pissing off the foreigners by not offering the subsidies that everybody else [gets], if you want to create the ecosystem, give these subsidies to everybody, because then they are stuck. They are already part of that ecosystem, and they cannot leave it anymore.” Beyond financial incentives, local Chinese governments have been actively courting Tesla to build production facilities in the country. Its Gigafactory in Shanghai was built extremely quickly in 2019 thanks to the favorable local policies. “To go from effectively a dirt field to job one in about a year is unprecedented,” says Tu. “It points to the central government, and particularly the Shanghai government, breaking down any barriers or roadblocks to get Tesla to that point.” Today, China is an indispensable part of Tesla’s supply chain. The Shanghai Gigafactory is currently Tesla’s most productive manufacturing hub and accounts for over half of Tesla cars delivered in 2022. But the benefits have been mutual; China has gained a lot from Tesla as well. The company has been responsible for imposing the “catfish effect” on the Chinese EV industry—meaning it’s forced Chinese brands to innovate and try to catch up with Tesla in everything from technology advancement to affordability. And now, even Tesla needs to figure out how to continue being competitive in China because domestic brands are coming at it hard. What role did battery technology play? The most important part of an electric vehicle is the battery cells, which can make up about 40% of the cost of a vehicle . And the most important factor in making an EV that’s commercially viable is a battery that’s powerful and reliable, yet still affordable. Chinese companies really pushed battery technology forward on this front, says Max Reid, senior research analyst in EVs and battery supply chain services at Wood Mackenzie, a global research firm. More specifically, over the past decade Chinese companies have championed lithium iron phosphate batteries, known as LFP technology, as opposed to the lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries that are much more popular in the West. Related Story Meet the new batteries unlocking cheaper electric vehicles A planned factory marks a major milestone in the US for new batteries that enable lower-cost, longer-lasting EVs. LFP batteries are safer and cheaper, but initially they weren’t the top choice in cars because they used to have much lower energy density and perform poorly in low temperatures. But while others were ditching LFP technology, a few Chinese battery companies, like Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), spent a decade researching them and managed to narrow the energy density gap. Today, the EV industry is again recognizing the benefits of LFP batteries, which made up one third of all EV batteries as of September 2022 . “That shows you how far LFP has come, and that’s purely down to the innovation within Chinese cell makers. And that has brought Chinese EV battery [companies] to the front line, the tier-one companies,” says Reid. China has also had one key advantage in battery manufacturing: it controls a lot of the necessary materials. While the country doesn’t necessarily have the most natural resources for battery materials, it has the majority of the refinery capacity in the world when it comes to critical components like cobalt, nickel sulfate, lithium hydroxide, and graphite. García-Herrero sees China’s control of the chemical materials as “the ultimate control of the sector, which China has clearly pursued for years well before others even figured that this was something important.” By now, other countries have indeed realized the importance of battery materials and are signing deals with Chile and Australia to gain control of mines for rare-earth metals. But China’s head start has given domestic companies a longstanding stable supply chain. “Chinese-made EV batteries … not only come at a discount but also are available in much higher quantities because the manufacturing capacity has been built out in China and continues to be built out,” says Reid. What does China’s EV market look like now? As a result of all this, China now has an outsize domestic demand for EVs: according to a survey from the US consulting company AlixPartners , over 50% of Chinese respondents were considering battery-electric vehicles as their next car in 2021, the highest proportion in the world and two times the global average. There are a slew of Chinese-built options for these customers—including BYD, SAIC-GM-Wuling, Geely, Nio, Xpeng, and LiAuto. While the first three are examples of gas-car companies that successfully made the switch to EVs early on, the last three are pure-EV startups that grew from nothing to household names in less than a decade. And the rise of these companies (and other Chinese tech behemoths) coincided with the rise of a new generation of car buyers who don’t see Chinese brands as less prestigious or worse in quality than foreign brands. “Because they’ve grown up with Alibaba, because they’ve grown up with Tencent, they effectively were born into a digital environment, and they’re much more comfortable with Chinese brands versus their parents, who would still rather likely buy a German brand or a Japanese brand,” says Tu. The fact that these Chinese brands have sprinkled a little bit of nationalism into their marketing strategy also helps, Tu says. Can other countries replicate China’s success? Many countries are almost certainly now looking at China’s EV experience and feeling jealous. But it may not be that easy for them to achieve the same success, even if they copy China’s playbook. While the US and some countries in Europe meet the objective requirements to supercharge their own EV industries, like technological capability and established supply chains, ICCT’s He notes that they also have different political systems. “Is this country willing to invest in this sector? Is it willing to give special protection to this industry and let it enjoy an extremely high level of policy priority for a long time?” she asks. “That’s hard to say.” “I think the interesting question is, would a country like India or Brazil be able to replicate this?” Mazzocco asks. These countries don’t have a traditional auto industry as strong as China’s, and they also don’t have the Chinese government’s sophisticated background in handling massive industrial policies through a diverse set of policy tools, including credits, subsidies, land use agreements, tax breaks, and public procurements. But China’s experience suggests that EVs can be an opportunity for developing countries to leapfrog developed countries. “It’s not that you can't replicate it, but China has had decades of experience in leveraging these [systems],” says Mazzocco. Chinese brands are now looking to other markets. What challenges are they facing? For the first time ever, Chinese EV companies feel they have a chance to expand outside of China and become global brands. Some of them are already entering the European market and even considering coming to the US, despite its saturated market and the sensitive political situation. Chinese gas cars could never have dreamed of that. Nevertheless, their marketing language and strategies may have to change for other markets. They will need to adapt to the different technical standards and preferred software services. And they will have to learn to accommodate different consumption habits and customer service requests. “I think we take for granted that a company like Toyota or Honda is comfortable navigating different markets, but that’s taken decades of experience to build up for these companies, and it didn’t always look pretty for them,” Mazzocco says. In the current geopolitical environment, these companies are also making themselves vulnerable by entering more countries that aren’t exactly maintaining good relations with China. Some of them may want to protect their own homegrown auto industries, and others may even see the entrance of Chinese brands as a national security risk. For these and other reasons, the most growth potential will likely come from “emerging Asia,” García-Herrero says. That region will continue to need more EVs for its energy transition even after China’s domestic market becomes saturated. This is why the benefits from China’s focus on EV supply are twofold: it both reduces China’s need for car imports from Western countries and creates another long-lasting export industry. Some countries, like Indonesia, are already courting Chinese investment to build EV factories there. In 2022, China exported 679,000 EVs , a 120% increase from the year before. There’s little reason to doubt the numbers will only grow from here. hide by Zeyi Yang Share linkedin link opens in a new window twitter link opens in a new window facebook link opens in a new window email link opens in a new window Popular 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024 The Editors The worst technology failures of 2023 Antonio Regalado AI for everything: 10 Breakthrough Technologies 2024 Will Douglas Heaven Scientists are finding signals of long covid in blood.

Exploring the Connection between Market Competition and EV Charging Costs In this article, we will delve into the connection between market competition and EV charging costs, highlighting the benefits, challenges, and key takeaways of this evolving landscape. The Rise of Electric Vehicles Electric vehicles have gained immense popularity in recent years, driven by increased environmental awareness, government initiatives, and advances in EV technology. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of electric cars on the road surpassed 10 million globally in 2020, a significant milestone in the transition to sustainable transportation. EVs are not only environmentally friendly, but they also offer numerous advantages over traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, such as lower maintenance costs, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, and improved overall efficiency. However, one of the key challenges in widespread EV adoption has been the availability and cost of charging infrastructure. The Importance of Market Competition Market competition plays a crucial role in driving innovation and efficiency in various industries, and the EV charging sector is no exception.

This is the moment to reimagine and rebuild a new economy. The American Jobs Plan is an investment in America that will create millions of good jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China. Public domestic investment as a share of the economy has fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1960s. The American Jobs Plan will invest in America in a way we have not invested since we built the interstate highways and won the Space Race. The United States of America is the wealthiest country in the world, yet we rank 13 th when it comes to the overall quality of our infrastructure. After decades of disinvestment, our roads, bridges, and water systems are crumbling. Our electric grid is vulnerable to catastrophic outages. Too many lack access to affordable, high-speed Internet and to quality housing. The past year has led to job losses and threatened economic security, eroding more than 30 years of progress in women’s labor force participation. It has unmasked the fragility of our caregiving infrastructure. And, our nation is falling behind its biggest competitors on research and development (R&D), manufacturing, and training. It has never been more important for us to invest in strengthening our infrastructure and competitiveness, and in creating the good-paying, union jobs of the future. Like great projects of the past, the President’s plan will unify and mobilize the country to meet the great challenges of our time: the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China. It will invest in Americans and deliver the jobs and opportunities they deserve. But unlike past major investments, the plan prioritizes addressing long-standing and persistent racial injustice. The plan targets 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities. And, the plan invests in rural communities and communities impacted by the market-based transition to clean energy. Specifically, President Biden’s plan will: Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems . The President’s plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main-streets. It will fix the ten most economically significant bridges in the country in need of reconstruction. It also will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, providing critical linkages to communities. And, it will replace thousands of buses and rail cars, repair hundreds of stations, renew airports, and expand transit and rail into new communities. Deliver clean drinking water, a renewed electric grid, and high-speed broadband to all Americans. President Biden’s plan will eliminate all lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems, improving the health of our country’s children and communities of color. It will put hundreds of thousands of people to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and capping hundreds of thousands of orphan oil and gas wells and abandoned mines. And, it will bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American, including the more than 35 percent of rural Americans who lack access to broadband at minimally acceptable speeds. Build, preserve, and retrofit more than two million homes and commercial buildings, modernize our nation’s schools and child care facilities, and upgrade veterans’ hospitals and federal buildings . President Biden’s plan will create good jobs building, rehabilitating, and retrofitting affordable, accessible, energy efficient, and resilient housing, commercial buildings, schools, and child care facilities all over the country, while also vastly improving our nation’s federal facilities, especially those that serve veterans. Solidify the infrastructure of our care economy by creating jobs and raising wages and benefits for essential home care workers . These workers – the majority of whom are women of color – have been underpaid and undervalued for too long. The President’s plan makes substantial investments in the infrastructure of our care economy, starting by creating new and better jobs for caregiving workers. His plan will provide home and community-based care for individuals who otherwise would need to wait as many as five years to get the services they badly need. Revitalize manufacturing, secure U.S. supply chains, invest in R&D, and train Americans for the jobs of the future . President Biden’s plan will ensure that the best, diverse minds in America are put to work creating the innovations of the future while creating hundreds of thousands of quality jobs today. Our workers will build and make things in every part of America, and they will be trained for well-paying, middle-class jobs. Create good-quality jobs that pay prevailing wages in safe and healthy workplaces while ensuring workers have a free and fair choice to organize, join a union, and bargain collectively with their employers . By ensuring that American taxpayers’ dollars benefit working families and their communities, and not multinational corporations or foreign governments, the plan will require that goods and materials are made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed vessels. The plan also will ensure that Americans who have endured systemic discrimination and exclusion for generations finally have a fair shot at obtaining good paying jobs and being part of a union. Alongside his American Jobs Plan, President Biden is releasing a Made in America Tax Plan to make sure corporations pay their fair share in taxes and encourage job creation at home. A recent study found that 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal taxes on U.S. income in 2018. Another study found that the average corporation paid just 8 percent in taxes. President Biden believes that profitable corporations should not be able to get away with paying little or no tax by shifting jobs and profits overseas. President Biden’s plan will reward investment at home, stop profit shifting, and ensure other nations won’t gain a competitive edge by becoming tax havens. The President’s American Jobs Plan is a historic public investment – consisting principally of one-time capital investments in our nation’s productivity and long-term growth. It will invest about 1 percent of GDP per year over eight years to upgrade our nation’s infrastructure, revitalize manufacturing, invest in basic research and science, shore up supply chains, and solidify our care infrastructure. These are investments that leading economists agree will give Americans good jobs now and will pay off for future generations by leaving the country more competitive and our communities stronger. In total, the plan will invest about $2 trillion this decade. If passed alongside President Biden’s Made in America corporate tax plan, it will be fully paid for within the next 15 years and reduce deficits in the years after. BUILD WORLD-CLASS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE: FIX HIGHWAYS, REBUILD BRIDGES, AND UPGRADE PORTS, AIRPORTS AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS President Biden is calling on Congress to make a historic and overdue investment in our roads, bridges, rail, ports, airports, and transit systems. The President’s plan will ensure that these investments produce good-quality jobs with strong labor standards, prevailing wages, and a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. These investments will advance racial equity by providing better jobs and better transportation options to underserved communities. These investments also will extend opportunities to small businesses to participate in the design, construction, and manufacturing of new infrastructure and component parts. President Biden’s plan will deliver infrastructure Americans can trust, because it will be resilient to floods, fires, storms, and other threats, and not fragile in the face of these increasing risks. President Biden is calling on Congress to: Transform our crumbling transportation infrastructure: Decades of declining public investment has left our roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems in poor condition, with a trillion-dollar backlog of needed repairs. More than 35,000 people die in traffic crashes on U.S. roads each year, and millions more are seriously and often permanently injured. The United States has one of the highest traffic fatality rates in the industrialized world, double the rate in Canada and quadruple that in Europe. Across cities, suburbs, and rural areas, President Biden’s plan will help parents get to work reliably and affordably, reduce the impacts of climate change for our kids, and make sure fewer families mourn the loss of a loved one to road crashes. His investments will use more sustainable and innovative materials, including cleaner steel and cement, and component parts Made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag vessels with American crews under U.S. laws. And, his infrastructure investments will mitigate socio-economic disparities, advance racial equity, and promote affordable access to opportunity. The President’s plan invests an additional $621 billion in transportation infrastructure and resilience. It will: Repair American roads and bridges . One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads are in poor condition, as well as 45,000 bridges. Delays caused by traffic congestion alone cost over $160 billion per year, and motorists are forced to pay over $1,000 every year in wasted time and fuel. The President is proposing a total increase of $115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair. This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce congestion. His plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets, not only “fixing them first” but “fixing them right,” with safety, resilience, and all users in mind. It will fix the most economically significant large bridges in the country in need of reconstruction, and it will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, including bridges that provide critical connections to rural and tribal communities. The plan includes $20 billion to improve road safety for all users, including increases to existing safety programs and a new Safe Streets for All program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians. Modernize public transit . Households that take public transportation to work have twice the commute time, and households of color are twice as likely to take public transportation. Our current transit infrastructure is inadequate – the Department of Transportation estimates a repair backlog of over $105 billion, representing more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. This translates to service delays and disruptions that leave riders stranded and discourage transit use. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $85 billion to modernize existing transit and help agencies expand their systems to meet rider demand. This investment will double federal funding for public transit, spend down the repair backlog, and bring bus, bus rapid transit, and rail service to communities and neighborhoods across the country. It will ultimately reduce traffic congestion for everyone. Invest in reliable passenger and freight rail service . The nation’s rail networks have the potential to offer safe, reliable, efficient, and climate-friendly alternatives for moving people and freight. However, unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential locations. There are currently projects just waiting to be funded that will give millions more Americans reliable and fast inter-city train service. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $80 billion to address Amtrak’s repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety, efficiency, and electrification. Create good jobs electrifying vehicles . U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. He is proposing a $174 billion investment to win the EV market. His plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs. It will give consumers point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs, while ensuring that these vehicles are affordable for all families and manufactured by workers with good jobs. It will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor, training, and installation standards. His plan also will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Department of Energy. These investments will set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses, while ensuring that the American workforce is trained to operate and maintain this 21 st century infrastructure. Finally, it will utilize the vast tools of federal procurement to electrify the federal fleet, including the United States Postal Service. Improve ports, waterways, and airports. The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $25 billion in our airports, including funding for the Airport Improvement Program, upgrades to FAA assets that ensure safe and efficient air travel, and a new program to support terminal renovations and multimodal connections for affordable, convenient, car-free access to air travel. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest an additional $17 billion in inland waterways, coastal ports, land ports of entry, and ferries, which are all essential to our nation’s freight. This includes a Healthy Ports program to mitigate the cumulative impacts of air pollution on neighborhoods near ports, often communities of color. These investments will position the United States as a global leader in clean freight and aviation. Redress historic inequities and build the future of transportation infrastructure. The President’s plan for transportation is not just ambitious in scale, it is designed with equity in mind and to set up America for the future. Too often, past transportation investments divided communities – like the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans or I-81 in Syracuse – or it left out the people most in need of affordable transportation options. The President’s plan includes $20 billion for a new program that will reconnect neighborhoods cut off by historic investments and ensure new projects increase opportunity, advance racial equity and environmental justice, and promote affordable access. The President’s plan will inspire basic research, like advanced pavements that recycle carbon dioxide, and “future proof” investments that will last decades to leave coming generations with a safe, equitable, and sustainable transportation system. And, the President’s plan will accelerate transformative investments, from pre-development through construction, turning “shovel worthy” ideas into “shovel ready” projects. This includes $25 billion for a dedicated fund to support ambitious projects that have tangible benefits to the regional or national economy but are too large or complex for existing funding programs. Invest resources wisely to deliver infrastructure projects that produce real results. America lags its peers – including Canada, the U.K., and Australia – in the on-time and on-budget delivery of infrastructure, and is falling behind countries like China on overall investment. Delivering this historic investment will require partnership across government, unions, and industry, to produce meaningful outcomes for the American people – reliable transportation, safe water, affordable housing, healthy schools, clean electricity, and broadband for all. When President Biden managed the implementation of the Recovery Act, he insisted on the strongest possible accountability and transparency measures to ensure public dollars were invested efficiently and effectively. When Congress enacts the American Jobs Plan, the President will bring the best practices from the Recovery Act and models from around the world to break down barriers and drive implementation of infrastructure investments across all levels of government to realize the President’s vision of safe, reliable, and resilient infrastructure. Critically, in order to achieve the best outcomes on cost and performance for the American people, the Administration will support the state, local, and tribal governments delivering these projects through world-class training, technical assistance, and procurement best practices. In addition, the President’s plan will use smart, coordinated infrastructure permitting to expedite federal decisions while prioritizing stakeholder engagement, community consultation, and maximizing equity, health, and environmental benefits. Make our infrastructure more resilient: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. Chronic underinvestment in resilience has harmed American transportation infrastructure, disrupting service, making travel conditions unsafe, causing severe damage, and increasing maintenance and operating costs. In 2020, the United States endured 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, costing $95 billion in damages to homes, businesses, and public infrastructure. In Louisiana, Hurricane Laura caused $19 billion of damage, resulting in broken water systems and a severely damaged electrical grid that impeded a quick recovery. Building back better requires that the investments in this historic plan make our infrastructure more resilient in the face of increasingly severe floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and other risks. Every dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of the climate crisis. Additionally, the President is calling for $50 billion in dedicated investments to improve infrastructure resilience and: Safeguard critical infrastructure and services, and defend vulnerable communities. People of color and low-income people are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. They also are less likely to have the funds to prepare for and recover from extreme weather events. In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely as white residents to report experiencing an income shock with no recovery support. President Biden’s plan increases resilience in the most essential services, including the electric grid; food systems; urban infrastructure; community health and hospitals; and our roads, rail, and other transportation assets. His plan also targets investments to support infrastructure in those communities most vulnerable physically and financially to climate-driven disasters and to build back above existing codes and standards. The President’s plan will invest in vulnerable communities through a range of programs, including FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, HUD’s Community Development Block Grant program, new initiatives at the Department of Transportation, a bipartisan tax credit to provide incentives to low- and middle-income families and to small businesses to invest in disaster resilience, and transition and relocation assistance to support community-led transitions for the most vulnerable tribal communities. Maximize the resilience of land and water resources to protect communities and the environment. President Biden’s plan will protect and, where necessary, restore nature-based infrastructure – our lands, forests, wetlands, watersheds, and coastal and ocean resources. Families and businesses throughout the United States rely on this infrastructure for their lives and livelihoods. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest in protection from extreme wildfires, coastal resilience to sea-level rise and hurricanes, support for agricultural resources management and climate-smart technologies, and the protection and restoration of major land and water resources like Florida’s Everglades and the Great Lakes. Additionally, the President’s plan provides funding for the western drought crisis by investing in water efficiency and recycling programs, Tribal Water Settlements, and dam safety. President Biden’s plan will empower local leaders to shape these restoration and resilience project funds in line with the Outdoor Restoration Force Act. REBUILD CLEAN DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, A RENEWED ELECTRIC GRID, AND HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND TO ALL AMERICANS Too many American families drink polluted water, lack access to affordable, high-speed internet, or experience power outages too often – all while paying more for those services. President Biden’s plan invests in the infrastructure necessary to finally deliver the water, broadband, and electricity service that Americans deserve. Specifically, his plan will: Ensure clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities: Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines. The President’s investments in improving water infrastructure and replacing lead service lines will create good jobs, including union and prevailing wage jobs. President Biden’s plan invests $111 billion to: Replace 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines. According to the CDC, there is no safe level of lead exposure for children. Lead can slow development and cause learning, behavior, and hearing problems in children, as well as lasting kidney and brain damage. President Biden believes that no American family should still be receiving drinking water through lead pipes and service lines. To eliminate all lead pipes and service lines in the country, he is calling on Congress to invest $45 billion in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and in Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) grants. In addition to reducing lead exposure in homes, this investment also will reduce lead exposure in 400,000 schools and childcare facilities. Upgrade and modernize America’s drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems, tackle new contaminants, and support clean water infrastructure across rural America. Aging water systems threaten public health in thousands of communities nationwide. President Biden will modernize these systems by scaling up existing, successful programs, including by providing $56 billion in grants and low-cost flexible loans to states, Tribes, territories, and disadvantaged communities across the country. President Biden’s plan also provides $10 billion in funding to monitor and remediate PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in drinking water and to invest in rural small water systems and household well and wastewater systems, including drainage fields. Revitalize America’s digital infrastructure: Generations ago, the federal government recognized that without affordable access to electricity, Americans couldn’t fully participate in modern society and the modern economy. With the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, the federal government made a historic investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and millions of families and our economy reaped the benefits. Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. Americans in rural areas and on tribal lands particularly lack adequate access. And, in part because the United States has some of the highest broadband prices among OECD countries, millions of Americans can’t use broadband internet even if the infrastructure exists where they live. In urban areas as well, there is a stark digital divide: a much higher percentage of White families use home broadband internet than Black or Latino families. The last year made painfully clear the cost of these disparities, particularly for students who struggled to connect while learning remotely, compounding learning loss and social isolation for those students. The President believes we can bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American through a historic investment of $100 billion. That investment will: Build high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach 100 percent coverage. The President’s plan prioritizes building “future proof” broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas so that we finally reach 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage. It also prioritizes support for broadband networks owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and co-operatives—providers with less pressure to turn profits and with a commitment to serving entire communities. Moreover, it ensures funds are set aside for infrastructure on tribal lands and that tribal nations are consulted in program administration. Along the way, it will create good-paying jobs with labor protections and the right to organize and bargain collectively. Promote transparency and competition. President Biden’s plan will promote price transparency and competition among internet providers, including by lifting barriers that prevent municipally-owned or affiliated providers and rural electric co-ops from competing on an even playing field with private providers, and requiring internet providers to clearly disclose the prices they charge. Reduce the cost of broadband internet service and promote more widespread adoption. President Biden believes that building out broadband infrastructure isn’t enough. We also must ensure that every American who wants to can afford high-quality and reliable broadband internet. While the President recognizes that individual subsidies to cover internet costs may be needed in the short term, he believes continually providing subsidies to cover the cost of overpriced internet service is not the right long-term solution for consumers or taxpayers. Americans pay too much for the internet – much more than people in many other countries – and the President is committed to working with Congress to find a solution to reduce internet prices for all Americans, increase adoption in both rural and urban areas, hold providers accountable, and save taxpayer money. Reenergize America’s power infrastructure: As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. The President’s plan will create a more resilient grid, lower energy bills for middle class Americans, improve air quality and public health outcomes, and create good jobs, with a choice to join a union, on the path to achieving 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $100 billion to: Build a more resilient electric transmission system. Through investments in the grid, we can move cheaper, cleaner electricity to where it is needed most. This starts with the creation of a targeted investment tax credit that incentivizes the buildout of at least 20 gigawatts of high-voltage capacity power lines and mobilizes tens of billions in private capital off the sidelines – right away. In addition, President Biden’s plan will establish a new Grid Deployment Authority at the Department of Energy that allows for better leverage of existing rights-of-way – along roads and railways – and supports creative financing tools to spur additional high priority, high-voltage transmission lines. These efforts will create good-paying jobs for union laborers, line workers, and electricians, in addition to creating demand for American-made building materials and parts. Spur jobs modernizing power generation and delivering clean electricity. President Biden is proposing a ten-year extension and phase down of an expanded direct-pay investment tax credit and production tax credit for clean energy generation and storage. These credits will be paired with strong labor standards to ensure the jobs created are good-quality jobs with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. President Biden’s plan will mobilize private investment to modernize our power sector. It also will support state, local, and tribal governments choosing to accelerate this modernization through complementary policies – like clean energy block grants that can be used to support clean energy, worker empowerment, and environmental justice. And, it will use the federal government’s incredible purchasing power to drive clean energy deployment across the market by purchasing 24/7 clean power for federal buildings. To ensure that we fully take advantage of the opportunity that modernizing our power sector presents, President Biden will establish an Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard (EECES) aimed at cutting electricity bills and electricity pollution, increasing competition in the market, incentivizing more efficient use of existing infrastructure, and continuing to leverage the carbon pollution-free energy provided by existing sources like nuclear and hydropower. All of this will be done while ensuring those facilities meet robust and rigorous standards for worker, public, and environmental safety as well as environmental justice – and all while moving toward 100 percent carbon-pollution free power by 2035. Put the energy industry to work plugging orphan oil and gas wells and cleaning up abandoned mines. Hundreds of thousands of former orphan oil and gas wells and abandoned mines pose serious safety hazards, while also causing ongoing air, water, and other environmental damage. Many of these old wells and mines are located in rural communities that have suffered from years of disinvestment. President Biden’s plan includes an immediate up-front investment of $16 billion that will put hundreds of thousands to work in union jobs plugging oil and gas wells and restoring and reclaiming abandoned coal, hardrock, and uranium mines. In addition to creating good jobs in hard-hit communities, this investment will reduce the methane and brine that leaks from these wells, just as we invest in reducing leaks from other sources like aging pipes and distribution systems. Remediate and redevelop idle real property, and spur the buildout of critical physical, social, and civic infrastructure in distressed and disadvantaged communities. In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. Through a $5 billion investment in the remediation and redevelopment of these Brownfield and Superfund sites, as well as related economic and workforce development, President Biden’s plan will turn this idle real property into new hubs of economic growth and job creation. But it’s not enough to redevelop old infrastructure. President Biden’s plan also will bring these communities new critical physical, social, and civic infrastructure. This means investing in the Economic Development Agency’s Public Works program (while lifting the cap of $3 million on projects) and in “Main Street” revitalization efforts through HUD and USDA. President Biden’s plan also will spur targeted sustainable, economic development efforts through the Appalachian Regional Commission’s POWER grant program, Department of Energy retooling grants for idled factories (through the Section 132 program), and dedicated funding to support community-driven environmental justice efforts – such as capacity and project grants to address legacy pollution and the cumulative impacts experienced by frontline and fenceline communities. Build next generation industries in distressed communities. President Biden believes that the market-based shift toward clean energy presents enormous opportunities for the development of new markets and new industries. For example, by pairing an investment in 15 decarbonized hydrogen demonstration projects in distressed communities with a new production tax credit, we can spur capital-project retrofits and installations that bolster and decarbonize our industry. The President’s plan also will establish ten pioneer facilities that demonstrate carbon capture retrofits for large steel, cement, and chemical production facilities, all while ensuring that overburdened communities are protected from increases in cumulative pollution. In addition, in line with the bipartisan SCALE Act, his plan will support large-scale sequestration efforts that leverage the best science and prioritize community engagement. And to accelerate responsible carbon capture deployment and ensure permanent storage, President Biden’s plan reforms and expands the bipartisan Section 45Q tax credit, making it direct pay and easier to use for hard-to-decarbonize industrial applications, direct air capture, and retrofits of existing power plants. Mobilize the next generation of conservation and resilience workers. This $10 billion investment will put a new, diverse generation of Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters, bolstering community resilience, and advancing environmental justice through a new Civilian Climate Corps, all while placing good-paying union jobs within reach for more Americans. BUILD, PRESERVE, AND RETROFIT MORE THAN TWO MILLION HOMES AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS; MODERNIZE OUR NATION’S SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND EARLY LEARNING FACILITIES; AND UPGRADE VETERANS’ HOSPITALS AND FEDERAL BUILDINGS There is a severe shortage of affordable housing options in America, and the American Society of Civil Engineers gives our school infrastructure a “D+.” President Biden believes we must invest in building and upgrading modern, resilient, and energy-efficient homes and buildings, including our nation’s schools, early learning facilities, veterans’ hospitals and other federal buildings, and in the process, employ American workers in jobs with good wages and benefits. President Biden’s plan will: Build, preserve, and retrofit more than two million homes and commercial buildings to address the affordable housing crisis: There is a severe shortage of affordable housing options in America. Millions of families pay more than half their income on rent, and home energy costs are a significant concern for American renters as well. And, across the country, people are struggling to purchase their first home. The President’s plan invests $213 billion to produce, preserve, and retrofit more than two million affordable and sustainable places to live. It pairs this investment with an innovative new approach to eliminate state and local exclusionary zoning laws, which drive up the cost of construction and keep families from moving to neighborhoods with more opportunities for them and their kids. The President’s plan will help address the growing cost of rent and create jobs that pay prevailing wages, including through project labor agreements with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. President Biden is calling on Congress to: Produce, preserve, and retrofit more than a million affordable, resilient, accessible, energy efficient, and electrified housing units. Through targeted tax credits, formula funding, grants, and project-based rental assistance, President Biden’s plan will extend affordable housing rental opportunities to underserved communities nationwide, including rural and tribal areas. Build and rehabilitate more than 500,000 homes for low- and middle-income homebuyers. President Biden is calling on Congress to take immediate steps to spur the construction and rehabilitation of homes for underserved communities. Specifically, he is calling on Congress to pass the innovative, bipartisan Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA). Offering $20 billion worth of NHIA tax credits over the next five years will result in approximately 500,000 homes built or rehabilitated, creating a pathway for more families to buy a home and start building wealth. Eliminate exclusionary zoning and harmful land use policies. For decades, exclusionary zoning laws – like minimum lot sizes, mandatory parking requirements, and prohibitions on multifamily housing – have inflated housing and construction costs and locked families out of areas with more opportunities. President Biden is calling on Congress to enact an innovative, new competitive grant program that awards flexible and attractive funding to jurisdictions that take concrete steps to eliminate such needless barriers to producing affordable housing. Address longstanding public housing capital needs. Years of disinvestment have left our public housing in disrepair. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $40 billion to improve the infrastructure of the public housing system in America. This funding will address critical life-safety concerns, mitigate imminent hazards to residents, and undertake energy efficiency measures which will significantly reduce ongoing operating expenses. These improvements will disproportionately benefit women, people of color, and people with disabilities. Put union building trade workers to work upgrading homes and businesses to save families money. President Biden’s plan will upgrade homes through block grant programs, the Weatherization Assistance Program, and by extending and expanding home and commercial efficiency tax credits. President Biden’s plan also will establish a $27 billion Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to mobilize private investment into distributed energy resources; retrofits of residential, commercial and municipal buildings; and clean transportation. These investments have a particular focus on disadvantaged communities that have not yet benefited from clean energy investments. Modernize our nation’s schools and early learning facilities: Too many students attend schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and pose health risks. These conditions are dangerous for our kids and exist disproportionately in schools with a high percentage of low-income students and students of color. And even before COVID-19, 43 percent of parents reported struggling to find an adequate child care facility for their children. President Biden is calling on Congress to: Modernize our public schools. President Biden believes we can’t close the opportunity gap if low-income kids go to schools in buildings that undermine health and safety, while wealthier students get access to safe buildings with labs and technology that prepare them for the jobs of the future. The President’s plan invests $100 billion to upgrade and build new public schools, through $50 billion in direct grants and an additional $50 billion leveraged through bonds. These funds will first go toward making sure our schools are safe and healthy places of learning for our kids and work for teachers and other education professionals, for example by improving indoor air quality and ventilation. As we make our schools safer, we also will invest in cutting-edge, energy-efficient and electrified, resilient, and innovative school buildings with technology and labs that will help our educators prepare students to be productive workers and valued students. Under the President’s plan, better operating school facilities will reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and also will become environments of community resilience with green space, clean air, and safe places to gather, especially during emergencies. Funds also will be provided to improve our school kitchens, so they can be used to better prepare nutritious meals for our students and go green by reducing or eliminating the use of paper plates and other disposable materials. Investing in community college infrastructure . Investing in community college facilities and technology helps protect the health and safety of students and faculty, address education deserts (particularly for rural communities), grow local economies, improve energy efficiency and resilience, and narrow funding inequities in the short-term, as we rebuild our higher education finance system for the long-run. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $12 billion to address these needs. States will be responsible for using the dollars to address both existing physical and technological infrastructure needs at community colleges and identifying strategies to address access to community college in education deserts. Upgrade child care facilities and build new supply in high need areas. Lack of access to child care makes it harder for parents, especially mothers, to fully participate in the workforce. In areas with the greatest shortage of child care slots, women’s labor force participation is about three percentage points less than in areas with a high capacity of child care slots, hurting families and hindering U.S. growth and competitiveness. President Biden is calling on Congress to provide $25 billion to help upgrade child care facilities and increase the supply of child care in areas that need it most. Funding would be provided through a Child Care Growth and Innovation Fund for states to build a supply of infant and toddler care in high-need areas. President Biden also is calling for an expanded tax credit to encourage businesses to build child care facilities at places of work. Employers will receive 50 percent of the first $1 million of construction costs per facility so that employees can enjoy the peace of mind and convenience that comes with on-site child care. These investments will provide safe, accessible, energy efficient, high-quality learning environments for providers to teach and care for children. Public investments in schools and childcare improves children’s outcomes—the foundation for future productivity gains. In classrooms with poor ventilation , for example, student absences are 10 to 20 percent higher. Upgrade VA hospitals and federal buildings: The federal government operates office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities in every state, where millions of workers serve the public from outdated, inefficient, and sometimes unsafe working conditions. While the median age of U.S. private sector hospitals is roughly 11 years, the Veterans Affairs’ hospital portfolio has a median age of 58. The President believes our veterans deserve state-of-the-art hospitals and care. President Biden’s plan provides $18 billion for the modernization of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. President Biden’s plan also invests $10 billion in the modernization, sustainability, and resilience of federal buildings, including through a bipartisan Federal Capital Revolving Fund to support investment in a major purchase, construction or renovation of Federal facilities. And, President Biden’s plan utilizes the vast tools of federal procurement to purchase low carbon materials for construction and clean power for these newly constructed VA hospitals and federal buildings. SOLIDIFY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR CARE ECONOMY BY CREATING JOBS AND RAISING WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR ESSENTIAL HOME CARE WORKERS Even before COVID-19, our country was in the midst of a caregiving crisis. In addition to caring for children, families feel the financial burden of caring for aging relatives and family members with disabilities, and there is a financial strain for people with disabilities living independently to ensure that they are getting care in their homes. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of people who need better care are unable to access it, even though they qualify under Medicaid. In fact, it can take years for these individuals to get the services they badly need. Aging relatives and people with disabilities deserve better. They deserve high-quality services and support that meet their unique needs and personal choices. Caregivers – who are disproportionally women of color – have been underpaid and undervalued for far too long. Wages for essential home care workers are approximately $12 per hour, putting them among the lowest paid workers in our economy. In fact, one in six workers in this sector live in poverty. President Biden is calling on Congress to make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. Specifically, he is calling on Congress to put $400 billion toward expanding access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care for aging relatives and people with disabilities. These investments will help hundreds of thousands of Americans finally obtain the long-term services and support they need, while creating new jobs and offering caregiving workers a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits, and an opportunity to organize or join a union and collectively bargain. Research shows that increasing the pay of direct care workers greatly enhances workers’ financial security, improves productivity, and increases the quality of care offered. Another study showed that increased pay for care workers prevented deaths, reduced the number of health violations, and lowered the cost of preventative care. President Biden’s plan will: Expand access to long-term care services under Medicaid. President Biden believes more people should have the opportunity to receive care at home, in a supportive community, or from a loved one. President Biden’s plan will expand access to home and community-based services (HCBS) and extend the longstanding Money Follows the Person program that supports innovations in the delivery of long-term care. Put in place an infrastructure to create good middle-class jobs with a free and fair choice to join a union. The HCBS expansion under Medicaid can support well-paying caregiving jobs that include benefits and the ability to collectively bargain, building state infrastructure to improve the quality of services and to support workers. This will improve wages and quality of life for essential home health workers and yield significant economic benefits for low-income communities and communities of color. INVEST IN R&D, REVITALIZE MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND TRAIN AMERICANS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE Half the jobs in our high growth, high wage sectors are concentrated in just 41 counties, locking millions of Americans out of a shot at a middle-class job. President Biden believes that, even in the face of automation and globalization, America can and must retain well-paid union jobs and create more of them all across the country. U.S. manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II and must be part of the Arsenal of American Prosperity today, helping fuel an economic recovery for working families. From the invention of the semiconductor to the creation of the Internet, new engines of economic growth have emerged due to public investments that support research, commercialization, and strong supply chains. President Biden is calling on Congress to make smart investments in research and development, manufacturing and regional economic development, and in workforce development to give our workers and companies the tools and training they need to compete on the global stage. Specifically, President Biden is calling on Congress to: Invest in R&D and the technologies of the future: Public investments in R&D lay the foundation for the future breakthroughs that over time yield new businesses, new jobs, and more exports. However, we need more investment if we want to maintain our economic edge in today’s global economy. We are one of the few major economies whose public investments in research and development have declined as a percent of GDP in the past 25 years. Countries like China are investing aggressively in R&D, and China now ranks number two in the world in R&D expenditures. In addition, barriers to careers in high-innovation sectors remain significant. We must do more to improve access to the higher wage sectors of our economy. In order to win the 21 st century economy, President Biden believes America must get back to investing in the researchers, laboratories, and universities across our nation. But this time, we must do so with a commitment to lifting up workers and regions who were left out of past investments. He is calling on Congress to make an $180 billion investment that will: Advance U.S. leadership in critical technologies and upgrade America’s research infrastructure. U.S. leadership in new technologies—from artificial intelligence to biotechnology to computing—is critical to both our future economic competitiveness and our national security. Based on bipartisan proposals, President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $50 billion in the National Science Foundation (NSF), creating a technology directorate that will collaborate with and build on existing programs across the government. It will focus on fields like semiconductors and advanced computing, advanced communications technology, advanced energy technologies, and biotechnology. He also is calling on Congress to provide $30 billion in additional funding for R&D that spurs innovation and job creation, including in rural areas. His plan also will invest $40 billion in upgrading research infrastructure in laboratories across the country, including brick-and-mortar facilities and computing capabilities and networks. These funds would be allocated across the federal R&D agencies, including at the Department of Energy. Half of those funds will be reserved for Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions, including the creation of a new national lab focused on climate that will be affiliated with an HBCU. Establish the United States as a leader in climate science, innovation, and R&D . The President is calling on Congress to invest $35 billion in the full range of solutions needed to achieve technology breakthroughs that address the climate crisis and position America as the global leader in clean energy technology and clean energy jobs. This includes launching ARPA-C to develop new methods for reducing emissions and building climate resilience, as well as expanding across-the-board funding for climate research. In addition to a $5 billion increase in funding for other climate-focused research, his plan will invest $15 billion in demonstration projects for climate R&D priorities, including utility-scale energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, advanced nuclear, rare earth element separations, floating offshore wind, biofuel/bioproducts, quantum computing, and electric vehicles, as well as strengthening U.S. technological leadership in these areas in global markets. Eliminate racial and gender inequities in research and development and science, technology, engineering, and math. Discrimination leads to less innovation : one study found that innovation in the United States will quadruple if women, people of color, and children from low-income families invented at the rate of groups who are not held back by discrimination and structural barriers. Persistent inequities in access to R&D dollars and to careers in innovation industries prevents the U.S. economy from reaching its full potential. President Biden is calling on Congress to make a $10 billion R&D investment at HBCUs and other MSIs. He also is calling on Congress to invest $15 billion in creating up to 200 centers of excellence that serve as research incubators at HBCUs and other MSIs to provide graduate fellowships and other opportunities for underserved populations, including through pre-college programs. Retool and revitalize American manufacturers and small businesses: The U.S. manufacturing sector accounts for 70 percent of business R&D expenditure, 30 percent of productivity growth, and 60 percent of exports. Manufacturing is a critical node that helps convert research and innovation into sustained economic growth. Workers on the factory floor work hand-in-hand with engineers and scientists to sharpen and maintain our competitive edge. While manufacturing jobs have been a ladder to middle-class life, we have let our industrial heartland be hollowed out, with quality jobs moving abroad or to regions with lower wages and fewer protections for workers. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $300 billion in order to: Strengthen manufacturing supply chains for critical goods. President Biden believes we must produce, here at home, the technologies and goods that meet today’s challenges and seize tomorrow’s opportunities. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $50 billion to create a new office at the Department of Commerce dedicated to monitoring domestic industrial capacity and funding investments to support production of critical goods. The President also is calling on Congress to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research, as called for in the bipartisan CHIPS Act. Protect Americans from future pandemics. This funding provides $30 billion over 4 years to create U.S. jobs and prevent the severe job losses caused by pandemics through major new investments in medical countermeasures manufacturing; research and development; and related biopreparedness and biosecurity. This includes investments to shore up our nation’s strategic national stockpile; accelerate the timeline to research, develop and field tests and therapeutics for emerging and future outbreaks; accelerate response time by developing prototype vaccines through Phase I and II trials, test technologies for the rapid scaling of vaccine production, and ensure sufficient production capacity in an emergency; enhance U.S. infrastructure for biopreparedness and investments in biosafety and biosecurity; train personnel for epidemic and pandemic response; and onshore active pharmaceutical ingredients.  COVID-19 has claimed over 500,000 American lives and cost trillions of dollars, demonstrating the devastating and increasing risk of pandemics and other biological threats. Over the past two decades, outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, influenza, Zika and others have cost billions in lost productivity. The risk of catastrophic biological threats is increasing due to our interconnected world, heightened risk of spillover from animals to humans, ease of making and modifying pandemic agents, and an eroding norm against the development and use of biological weapons.  The American Rescue Plan serves as an initial investment of $10 billion. With this new major investment in preventing future pandemics, the United States will build on the momentum from the American Rescue Plan, bolster scientific leadership, create jobs, markedly decrease the time from discovering a new threat to putting shots in arms, and prevent future biological catastrophes. Jumpstart clean energy manufacturing through federal procurement. The federal government spends more than a half-a-trillion dollars buying goods and services each year. As a result, it has the ability to be a first-mover in markets. This incredible purchasing power can be used to drive innovation and clean energy production, as well as to support high quality jobs.  To meet the President’s goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the United States will need more electric vehicles, charging ports, and electric heat pumps for residential heating and commercial buildings. The President is calling on Congress to enable the manufacture of those cars, ports, pumps, and clean materials, as well as critical technologies like advanced nuclear reactors and fuel, here at home through a $46 billion investment in federal buying power, creating good-paying jobs and reinvigorating local economies, especially in rural areas. Make it in ALL of America. The President believes we must build social infrastructure to support innovation and productivity across the country. He is calling on Congress to invest $20 billion in regional innovation hubs and a Community Revitalization Fund. At least ten regional innovation hubs will leverage private investment to fuel technology development, link urban and rural economies, and create new businesses in regions beyond the current handful of high-growth centers. The Community Revitalization Fund will support innovative, community-led redevelopment projects that can spark new economic activity, provide services and amenities, build community wealth, and close the current gaps in access to the innovation economy for communities of color and rural communities that have suffered from years of disinvestment. And, President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $14 billion in NIST to bring together industry, academia, and government to advance technologies and capabilities critical to future competitiveness. He is calling on Congress to quadruple support for the Manufacturing Extensions Partnership —increasing the involvement of minority-owned and rurally-located small- and-medium-sized enterprises in technological advancement. Increase access to capital for domestic manufacturers. America’s manufacturing industry needs to innovate, adapt, and scale to win the industries of the future. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest more than $52 billion in domestic manufacturers. The President is calling on Congress to invest in existing capital access programs with a proven track record of success, with a focus on supporting rural manufacturing and clean energy. The President’s plan also includes specific supports for modernizing supply chains, including in the auto sector, like extending the 48C tax credit program. He also will call for the creation of a new financing program to support debt and equity investments for manufacturing to strengthen the resilience of America’s supply chains. Create a national network of small business incubators and innovation hubs . Almost all manufacturers (98 percent) are small- and medium-sized firms. Furthermore, small business ownership is a cornerstone of job creation and wealth building. However, even before the pandemic, many entrepreneurs struggled to compete in a system that is so often tilted in favor of large corporations and wealthy individuals. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $31 billion in programs that give small businesses access to credit, venture capital, and R&D dollars. The proposal includes funding for community-based small business incubators and innovation hubs to support the growth of entrepreneurship in communities of color and underserved communities. Partner with rural and Tribal communities to create jobs and economic growth in rural America. Today, despite the fact that rural and Tribal communities across the country are asset-rich, more than 8 in 10 persistent poverty counties fall outside of a metropolitan area. President Biden’s plan invests in rural and Tribal communities, including by providing 100 percent broadband coverage, rebuilding crumbling infrastructure like roads, bridges, and water systems, providing research and development funding to land grant universities, and positioning the U.S. agricultural sector to lead the shift to net-zero emissions while providing new economic opportunities for farmers. President Biden also is proposing to transform the way the federal government partners with rural and Tribal communities to create jobs and spur inclusive economic growth.  Rural communities often don’t have the same budget as big cities to hire staff needed to navigate and access federal programs. On top of that, they have to navigate a myriad of programs all with different purposes and requirements. As part of his plan to ensure that all communities recover – regardless of geography – President Biden is proposing a $5 billion for a new Rural Partnership Program to help rural regions, including Tribal Nations, build on their unique assets and realize their vision for inclusive community and economic development. This program will empower rural regions by supporting locally-led planning and capacity building efforts, and providing flexible funding to meet critical needs. Invest in Workforce Development: As more Americans rejoin the workforce or seek out new opportunities in a changing economy, there is a greater need for skills development opportunities for workers of all kind. In order to ensure workers have ready access to the skills they will need to succeed, and to improve racial and gender equity, President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $100 billion in proven workforce development programs targeted at underserved groups and getting our students on paths to careers before they graduate from high school. His plan will: Pair job creation efforts with next generation training programs. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest in evidence-based approaches to supporting workers. This includes wraparound services, income supports, counseling, and case management, paired with high-quality training and effective partnerships between educational institutions, unions, and employers. Specifically, he is calling for a $40 billion investment in a new Dislocated Workers Program and sector-based training. This funding will ensure comprehensive services for workers, who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, to gain new skills and to get career services they need with in-demand jobs. Sector-based training programs will be focused on growing, high demand sectors such as clean energy, manufacturing, and caregiving, helping workers of all kinds to find good-quality jobs in an ever-changing economy. Target workforce development opportunities in underserved communities . Structural racism and persistent economic inequities have undermined opportunity for millions of workers. All of the investments in workforce training will prioritize underserved communities and communities hit hard by a transforming economy. President Biden also will call upon Congress to ensure that new jobs created in clean energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure are open and accessible to women and people of color. President Biden is calling on Congress to also specifically target funding to workers facing some of the greatest challenges, with a $12 billion investment. This includes $5 billion over eight years in support of evidence-based community violence prevention programs. He is calling on Congress to invest in job training for formerly incarcerated individuals and justice-involved youth and in improving public safety. He also is calling on Congress to tackle long-term unemployment and underemployment through a new subsidized jobs program. And, he is calling on Congress to eliminate sub-minimum wage provisions in section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and expand access to competitive, integrated employment opportunities and fair wages for workers with disabilities. Build the capacity of the existing workforce development and worker protection systems . The United States has underinvested in the workforce development system for decades. In fact, we currently spend just one-fifth of the average that other advanced economies spend on workforce and labor market programs. This lack of investment impacts all of us: better educated workers create spillover effects for other workers and lack of employment has negative social impacts on communities. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest a combined $48 billion in American workforce development infrastructure and worker protection. This includes registered apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships, creating one to two million new registered apprenticeships slots, and strengthening the pipeline for more women and people of color to access these opportunities through successful pre-apprenticeship programs such as the Women in Apprenticeships in Non-Traditional Occupations. This will ensure these underserved groups have greater access to new infrastructure jobs. These investments include the creation of career pathway programs in middle and high schools, prioritizing increased access to computer science and high-quality career and technical programs that connect underrepresented students to STEM and in-demand sectors through partnerships with both institutions of higher education and employers. The President’s plan also will support community college partnerships that build capacity to deliver job training programs based on in-demand skills. His plan will better tailor services to workers’ job seeking and career development needs through investments in Expanded Career Services and the Title II adult literacy program. The President’s plan includes funding to strengthen the capacity of our labor enforcement agencies to protect against discrimination, protect wages and benefits, enforce health and safety safeguards, strengthen health care and pensions plans, and promote union organizing and collective bargaining. CREATE GOOD-QUALITY JOBS THAT PAY PREVAILING WAGES IN SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACES WHILE ENSURING WORKERS HAVE A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE TO ORGANIZE, JOIN A UNION, AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of a deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and a reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone. We owe it not only to those who have put in a lifetime of work, but to the next generation of workers who have only known an America of rising inequality and shrinking opportunity. This is especially important for workers of color and for women, who have endured discrimination and systematic exclusion from economic opportunities for generations. All of us deserve to enjoy America’s promise in full — and our nation’s leaders have a responsibility to overcome racial, gender, and other inequalities to make it happen. To that end, the President is calling on Congress to create new, good-quality union jobs for American workers by leveraging their grit and ingenuity to address the climate crisis and build a sustainable infrastructure. Increased unionization can also impact our economic growth overall by improving productivity. President Biden’s plan will: Empower Workers . President Biden is calling on Congress to update the social contract that provides workers with a fair shot to get ahead, overcome racial and other inequalities that have been barriers for too many Americans, expand the middle class, and strengthen communities. He is calling on Congress to ensure all workers have a free and fair choice to join a union by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, and guarantee union and bargaining rights for public service workers. His plan also ensures domestic workers receive the legal benefits and protections they deserve and tackles pay inequities based on gender. Create good jobs . The President’s plan demands that employers benefitting from these investments follow strong labor standards and remain neutral when their employees seek to organize a union and bargain collectively. He is asking Congress to tie federal investments in clean energy and infrastructure to prevailing wages and require transportation investments to meet existing transit labor protections. He also is calling for investments tied to Project Labor, Community Workforce, local hire, and registered apprenticeships and other labor or labor-management training programs so that federal investments support good jobs and pathways to the middle class. Finally, he is asking Congress to include a commitment to increasing American jobs through Buy America and Ship American provisions. Protect workers . President Biden is calling on Congress to provide the federal government with the tools it needs to ensure employers are providing workers with good jobs – including jobs with fair and equal pay, safe and healthy workplaces, and workplaces free from racial, gender, and other forms of discrimination and harassment. In addition to a $10 billion investment in enforcement as part of the plan’s workforce proposals, the President is calling for increased penalties when employers violate workplace safety and health rules. THE MADE IN AMERICA TAX PLAN Alongside the American Jobs Plan, the President is proposing to fix the corporate tax code so that it incentivizes job creation and investment here in the United States, stops unfair and wasteful profit shifting to tax havens, and ensures that large corporations are paying their fair share. The 2017 tax law only made an unfair system worse. A recent independent study found that 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes on U.S. income in 2018. In fact, according to recent analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. A number of the provisions in the 2017 law also created new incentives to shift profits and jobs overseas. President Biden’s reform will reverse this damage and fundamentally reform the way the tax code treats the largest corporations. President Biden’s reform will also make the United States a leader again in the world and help bring an end to the race-to-the-bottom on corporate tax rates that allows countries to gain a competitive advantage by becoming tax havens. This is a generational opportunity to fundamentally shift how countries around the world tax corporations so that big corporations can’t escape or eliminate the taxes they owe by offshoring jobs and profits from the United States. Together these corporate tax changes will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis: Set the Corporate Tax Rate at 28 percent. The President’s tax plan will ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes by increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. His plan will return corporate tax revenue as a share of the economy to around its 21 st century average from before the 2017 tax law and well below where it stood before the 1980s. This will help fund critical investments in infrastructure, clean energy, R&D, and more to maintain the competitiveness of the United States and grow the economy. Discourage Offshoring by Strengthening the Global Minimum Tax for U.S. Multinational Corporations. Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate. Moreover, the 2017 tax law allows companies to use the taxes they pay in high-tax countries to shield profits in tax havens, encouraging offshoring of jobs. The President’s tax reform proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries. By creating incentives for investment here in the United States, we can reward companies that help to grow the U.S. economy and create a more level playing field between domestic companies and multinationals. End the Race to the Bottom Around the World. The United States can lead the world to end the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates. A minimum tax on U.S. corporations alone is insufficient. That can still allow foreign corporations to strip profits out of the United States, and U.S. corporations can potentially escape U.S. tax by inverting and switching their headquarters to foreign countries. This practice must end. President Biden is also proposing to encourage other countries to adopt strong minimum taxes on corporations, just like the United States, so that foreign corporations aren’t advantaged and foreign countries can’t try to get a competitive edge by serving as tax havens. This plan also denies deductions to foreign corporations on payments that could allow them to strip profits out of the United States if they are based in a country that does not adopt a strong minimum tax. It further replaces an ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States. The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations. This provision makes our commitment to a global minimum tax clear. The time has come to level the playing field and no longer allow countries to gain a competitive edge by slashing corporate tax rates. Prevent U.S. Corporations from inverting or claiming tax havens as their residence. Under current law, U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States. President Biden is proposing to make it harder for U.S. corporations to invert. This will backstop the other reforms which should address the incentive to do so in the first place. Deny Companies Expense Deductions for Offshoring Jobs and Credit Expenses for Onshoring. President Biden’s reform proposal will also make sure that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. This is a matter of fairness. U.S. taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize companies shipping jobs abroad. Instead, President Biden is also proposing to provide a tax credit to support onshoring jobs. Eliminate a Loophole for Intellectual Property that Encourages Offshoring Jobs and Invest in Effective R&D Incentives. The President’s ambitious reform of the tax code also includes reforming the way it promotes research and development. This starts with a complete elimination of the tax incentives in the Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&D. All of the revenue from repealing the FDII deduction will be used to expand more effective R&D investment incentives. Enact A Minimum Tax on Large Corporations’ Book Income. The President’s tax reform will also ensure that large, profitable corporations cannot exploit loopholes in the tax code to get by without paying U.S. corporate taxes. A 15 percent minimum tax on the income corporations use to report their profits to investors—known as “book income”—will backstop the tax plan’s other ambitious reforms and apply only to the very largest corporations. Eliminate Tax Preferences for Fossil Fuels and Make Sure Polluting Industries Pay for Environmental Clean Up . The current tax code includes billions of dollars in subsidies, loopholes, and special foreign tax credits for the fossil fuel industry. As part of the President’s commitment to put the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, his tax reform proposal will eliminate all these special preferences. The President is also proposing to restore payments from polluters into the Superfund Trust Fund so that polluting industries help fairly cover the cost of cleanups. Ramping Up Enforcement Against Corporations. All of these measures will make it much harder for the largest corporations to avoid or evade taxes by eliminating parts of the tax code that are too easily abused. This will be paired with an investment in enforcement to make sure corporations pay their fair share. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent. This plan will reverse these trends, and make sure that the Internal Revenue Service has the resources it needs to effectively enforce the tax laws against corporations. This will be paired with a broader enforcement initiative to be announced in the coming weeks that will address tax evasion among corporations and high-income Americans. These are key steps toward a fairer tax code that encourages investment in the United States, stops shifting of jobs and profits abroad, and makes sure that corporations pay their fair share. The President looks forward to working with Congress, and will be putting forward additional ideas in the coming weeks for reforming our tax code so that it rewards work and not wealth, and makes sure the highest income individuals pay their fair share. ### Next Post: A Proclamation on César Chávez Day, 2021 A Proclamation on César Chávez Day, 2021 March 31, 2021 • Presidential Actions Next Post Stay Connected Sign Up Email Address * Required ZIP Code Please leave blank.

Historical data 2. Global EV market 3. Other electric vehicles 4. EV charging 5. Technological development 6. The environmental impact of EVs 7. EV-related policies 8. EVs & the private sector 9. 2030 (and beyond) forecasts The global electric vehicle market share has taken a tremendous leap forward in the past decade, and we expect the trend to only accelerate in the coming years. Even though we’ve already seen some incredible growth in the number of EVs worldwide, the EV industry predictions suggest that we’ve only just scratched the surface . 1. Historical data oN the global EV market To understand the current situation of the EV sector, let’s look at what happened in the past couple of years. The year 2020 did not show a significant growth in overall new car registrations. The global market for all types of cars was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn that followed. Amid the pandemic, the outlook for global EV sales was quite unpredictable at the beginning of the year. However, as time showed, 2020 turned out to be a surprisingly positive year, with global EV sales growing by 43% from 2019 and the global electric car industry market share rising to a record 4,6% in 2020. The year 2021 was a major leap forward for electric vehicle sales. Sales of electric vehicles doubled from 202 0 to 6.75 million. The number of EVs sold in a week in 2021 was higher than how many were sold in the whole year of 2012. While we’re heading in the right direction, the road to full electrification is still long — but it’s becoming a reality. 2. Global electric car market share and size EVs are to play a central role in the ambitious objective of zero-emission targets set for 2050 , and the industry is gearing up for it. The year 2022 came on strong, breaking records . EV sales exceeded 10 million , with 14% of all new cars sold being electric , quite the jump from 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. That resulted in more than 26 million electric cars roaming global roads in 2022 , representing a 60% uptake from 2021. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 The market is growing. It’s growing fast. And it’s growing everywhere. Carried by a decarbonisation challenge most leading nations now take seriously and supported by various policies and incentives , global EV sales keep accelerating in 202 3 . 2.3 million EVs were sold only in the first quarter of the year. That is 25% more than in the same time in 2022. We're predicted to see 14 million in sales by the end of 2023 . Electric cars could account for 18% of total car sales by then. Source: EV volumes How's the situation in Europe? Europe experienced a downturn in EV sales in 2022 compared to the exceptional growth seen in 2020 and 2021. But the continent still remained 2 nd largest market for electric vehicles . Electric car sales were more than 15% higher compared to 2021 and reached 2.7 million. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 Despite the downturn, the continent’s EV sales continue to increase steadily, reflecting the recent implementation of stricter rules regarding CO2 emission standards, such as the mandated 100% reduction in CO2 emissions for new cars and vans from 2035. Not to mention, EV sales growth can also be attributed to stimulus measures introduced by many European governments and various tax benefits and subsidies put in place in major markets. Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany remain to be the largest European markets , according to the 2023 Global EV Outlook by IEA. 3. The state of other electric vehicles While passenger cars typically get all the credit for the EV revolution, it’s good also to consider other forms of transportation that are gradually becoming greener. From public transportation to e-scooters: The entire transportation industry is turning electric Light commercial vehicles (LCV) In 2022, the sales share of electric LCVs was higher than that of passenger EVs for the first time. Electric LCVs saw tremendous growth in 2022 as sales increased by over 90%, even though the overall LCV sales declined. Worldwide, there were about 310 000 electric LCVs in 2022. As more electric LCV models enter the market and commercial customers become aware of the ‘reduced cost’ benefit of electric LCVs, we expect the market to only accelerate in the future. Heavy-duty trucks Almost 60 000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks were sold worldwide in 2022. As m any truck manufacturers strive for an all-electric future , the number of commercially available zero-emission truck models has expanded in 2022. The market offers over 840 models by more than 100 OEMs. The electrification of the heavy-duty sector is a crucial part of the journey to a zero-emission future because even though they only account for 10% of all ICE vehicles, they are responsible for 70% of ICE CO2 emissions. Governments are well aware, and various countries are pledging to achieve 100% zero-emission truck sales by 2040. In 2022, the US and the EU proposed higher emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Buses Electric buses have been growing in popularity since 2020. In 2022, almost 66 000 electric buses were sold globally. China dominated the market, accounting for over 80% of global electric bus sales. The country also excels in manufacturing electric buses and is a major exporter to Latin American, North American and European countries. In the European Union countries, the Clean Vehicles Directive provides targets for public procurement of electric buses. France, Germany, and Spain are only a few EU countries witnessing increased electric bus sales. In 2022, Finland saw Europe's highest sales share of electric buses. Electric bus sales accounted for more than 65% there. Two and three-wheelers Historically, China dominated the electric two-wheeler market and continued to do so in 2022 despite sales dropping from over 10 million in 2021 to less than 7.7 million in 2022. This drop can be explained by supply chain challenges following the Covid-19 pandemic. In terms of electric three-wheelers, India leads the race with 425 000 units sold in 2022. Together with China, where almost 350 000 three-wheelers were sold in 2022, these two countries accounted for nearly 99% of global sales. 4. The state of EV charging Most charging still happens at home or work , but the more electric vehicles roaming the roads, the more public charging points are needed to support the wide EV uptake . In 2022, there were 2.7 million public charging points globally. 900 000 of these were installed over the year, accounting for 55% growth from 2021. For both slow AC charging and fast DC charging, China dominated the market in 2022. During the year, 360 000 slow and almost 297 000 fast charging points were installed in China. And how about Europe? In 202 2 , we counted over 450 000 publicly available EV chargers in Europe . By 2025, it's estimated that 1.3 million charging stations will be publicly accessible , and the number should grow to 2.9 million by 2030. The Netherlands takes the lead in deploying EV charging infrastructure, followed by France and Germany. Italy and Spain also make it to the top 5, with Spain's public charging infrastructure growing by 223% in 2022 compared to the previous year. S ource: Power2Drive Europe based on European Alternative Fuels Observatory EAFO EV charging trends Fast(er) chargers make longer journeys much more comfortable and might be a reason for those without private charging access to buy an electric vehicle. They are the most efficient way to fight range anxiety (or how far one can go with an EV before having to stop and recharge). In Europe, slow chargers are being replaced by fast and ultra-fast chargers . In 202 2 , the number of fast chargers was up by more than 55 % and reached almost 7 0 000 units. The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) , revised in the first quarter of 2023, sets requirements for EV charging coverage across Europe. This regulation highlights the ambition to develop public charging infrastructure across the continent further. For example, the EU’s Member States need to make sure there is a fast-charging pool every 60 km in each direction of travel by 2025 along the main European routes . Another trend that’s steadily increasing in the EV space is the smart charging of electric vehicles , i.e. the use of cloud-connected charging devices. For business owners and consumers alike, smart EV charging allows — among other things— greater convenience and control over electricity consumption. Lastly, we can't mention EV charging trends without acknowledging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) . V2G technology makes it possible to transfer the electricity stored in electric vehicle batteries back to the grid in the same way stationary storages are connected to the grid. V2G services are already commercially available, and several charger manufacturers can supply V2G chargers. The V2G market is projected to grow to over €4,5 billion by 2024. The European standard for V2G charging, ISO 15118-20 , developed back in 2020, defines the requirements for bidirectional charging. Virta has been recognised as one of the global leaders in V2G technology. Want to learn more about V2G and smart charging? Read our quick guide on bi-directional charging. → Learn more here And for even more information about smart charging (including the definition, benefits, practical how-tos, and more), take a look at our comprehensive Smart Charging guide! 5. The development of electric vehicle & charging technology Another interesting perspective relates to developing new EV parts and charging technologies. The increase in electric car registrations resulted in an increased production of automotive lithium-ion batteries. In 2022, EV battery demand increased by 65% from the previous year as EV sales continued to grow in all markets , especially in China . The battery demand increase can be attributed to the growing sales of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which require batteries larger in size as opposed to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). China remains the leading country for battery production , specifically heavy-duty battery production. However , Europe is not staying behind. According to BloombergNEF, Europe’s share of global battery production could rise to 31% by 2030. It's clear that to support the growing demand for electric vehicles, the various elements of the EV battery supply chain will have to increase, from the extraction of raw materials such as lithium or nickel to the EV production itself. A variety of developments in battery characteristics, driven by high demand, will provide multiple benefits to the EV business. For the EV market, further technological advances include: changes in battery chemistry changes in energy density changes in the size of battery packs Ultimately, these changes will lead to cost reductions and increased production efficiency. Several EV manufacturing plants plan to expand their electric car production capacity because of increased policy support. This is good news for the market at large since it means that the supply of EVs will be able to catch up with the demand. And if that wasn’t enough, we’re also working on some exciting stuff here at Virta. For example, our proprietary Plug&Charge feature allows our customers to identify themselves directly by connecting their vehicles to a charger. No pin codes, RFID tags, or credit cards are necessary. 6. The environmental impact of EVs Altogether EVs consumed approximately 110 terawatt-hours of electricity in 202 2 , doubling from the previous year . In the future, EVs are projected to account for less than 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030. As the electricity demand for charging electric vehicles grows, the need to protect the electricity grid grows with it. Careful planning of electricity infrastructure, the widespread use of smart charging and the implementation of smart energy management solutions for load management will all be crucial to ensure healthy and balanced power systems. In 2022, EV use saved more than 80 million tonnes of GHG emissions EVs globally. In practice, all EV emissions are born due to the manufacturing process, while we can’t apply similar logic to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. In the grand scheme of things, it’s safe to conclude that the public debate over EVs vs ICE cars’ environmental impact is turning in favour of EVs. Future predictions based on the Stated Policies Scenario say that in 2030, using EVs could help avoid 70 0 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of GHG emissions . The Announced Pledges Scenario takes this number even further, predicting over 770 Mt of CO2-eq. Are electric vehicles (really) green? We debunked a lot of the misinformation circulating about EVs and what it takes to produce them. Read it here — Myth buster: Electric vehicles are not green . While it’s true that EVs increase electricity consumption, that can become the saving grace of energy utilities in the future. By the 2040s, electric vehicles will add up to over 30 TWh of installed battery storage capacity. For utilities, this means that EVs offer cheap energy storage, with no capital cost and relatively low operating costs. 7. The current EV-related policies It’s no secret that governmental and local policies play a huge role in accelerating EV adoption. In 2022, EV-related policies accounted for over 90% of global LDV sales and 70% of HDV and two/three-wheeler sales. Major markets (China, the US, Europe) currently seeing rapidly growing EV sales began their EV journeys by introducing policies like vehicle purchase incentives. These markets are now shifting from incentivising the sales of electric cars towards supporting heavy-duty transportation and EV charging. Example: The United Kingdom The country stopped subsidising the sales of electric cars and dedicated GBP 1.6 billion to growing the public charging infrastructure. It's expected that 300 000 public chargers will be installed in the country by 2030. EV-related policies are crucial in driving countries towards their electrification targets. While some countries strive for 100% electrified sales, others plan to ban the sales of ICE vehicles completely. Let's take a closer look at the varying electrification targets of countries globally and their timeline. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 8. The private sector’s response to EVs The private sector, and car manufacturers, in particular, have responded positively to the ongoing changes in the market. Many car manufacturers have announced electrification of their fleets either partially or fully. Let's look at some of the major automakers' electrification targets. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 On the fleet side, EV100 , a global initiative supporting the switch to zero-emission transportation with its 130 members, is committed to switching to electric and installing charging infrastructure for employees and customers by 2030. To list a few examples, Unilever pledges to transition its fleet of more than 11 000 vehicles to electric and install workplace EV charging for their staff. ABB also plans to switch to electric for their 11 000 fleet vehicles. But it's not only the companies that are part of EV100 introducing ambitious pledges. DHL has pledged to reach 70% clean operations of last-mile pick-ups and deliveries by 2025. And DB Schenker wants to make its transport activities in European cities emission-free by 2030. While actions like these are worthy of attention on their own, their fringe benefit is that they act as signalling devices for the rest of the market. In other words, public pledges like these pressure competitors and stakeholders to act faster than they otherwise would have. 9. Forecasts: EV market outlook by 2030 and beyond When it comes to the future, according to the Global EV Outlook 2023 , there are three possible scenarios: The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) suggests that by 2030, the global electric vehicle stock (excluding two/three-wheelers) will reach nearly 240 million vehicles and account for over 10% of the global vehicle fleet. According to a bit more ambitious scenario, the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) , almost 250 million EVs will be roaming global roads by 2030, and EV sales will represent over 35% of all vehicle sales. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) predicts that the global EV stock will reach 380 million EVs, with EV sales climbing up to 60% of all vehicle sales in 2030. What about Europe? The next few years will be crucial for Europe to secure its leading status. We expect to reach a first milestone of 14 million EVs by 2025. After that, low estimates mention 33 million EVs by 2030, while high estimates talk about 40 million EVs roaming around Europe at the same time . From 2035 onwards, we expect 100 % of new cars sold in Europe to be electric. Of course, only time (and new data) will tell us if those predictions are to become realities. However, the latest trends are heading in the right direction. In other words, the time businesses embark on the EV train is now!

While this brings both opportunities and challenges to established auto exporters worldwide, it could ultimately push the industry towards a more sustainable infrastructure that can benefit both the environment and consumers. China's supremacy in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and its exports are reshaping the global automotive landscape. China is strategically targeting both developing economies' nascent EV markets and developed nations through competitive exports. This shift represents tectonic geoeconomic risks at the expense of Western producers, particularly in Europe, but also in Canada, the UK, and the US. 1 China now has the largest percentage share of the global EV market, accounting for approximately 50% or more of global EV production and exports. 2 As Chinese EV automakers increasingly export affordable and diverse alternatives, 3 China’s presence is sharply rising in global value chains related to critical and emerging technologies. The West and other economies have taken active steps to prevent the Chinese industry’s further rise. However, halting China's dominance in the rapidly evolving EV sector remains a hugely difficult task. Related Article The geopolitics of electric vehicles: techno-nationalism reshapes the automotive industry Alex Capri 03 November 2021 Recently, the EU has raised concerns over significant Chinese state support for the EV industry, the rapid rise of cheap exports to Europe, and a growing overcapacity in China. The European Commission cites these factors as a threat to the EU's own electric vehicle industry, which is still striving to become profitable. 4 To address these concerns, the Commission has initiated an investigation, considering the threat of injury rather than documented harm. This approach is being taken to prevent a repeat of Europe's experience in the solar photovoltaic sector, where state-supported Chinese players disrupted the EU's domestic industry. The EU argues that the influx of low-priced Chinese EVs, coupled with rising production capacity, poses an imminent threat to both the European and global auto industry. The European Commission believes that many of these less expensive vehicles could flood the European market and beyond, making it challenging for other companies to compete. China's rapid ascent in the EV sector is partly attributed to the absence of significant entry barriers or bottlenecks. Unlike certain industries like semiconductor manufacturing, which require substantial capital investments and advanced technological capabilities, EV production involves readily available technology and less complex manufacturing processes. This accessibility lowers the barriers to entry for both established automakers and new entrants, facilitating China's remarkable rise in the sector. China boasts an immense manufacturing infrastructure that can be quickly adapted to EV production. The country's experience in mass production of conventional vehicles, consumer electronics, and other products provides a significant advantage. China's automakers can leverage their existing production facilities and skilled labor force to scale up EV production rapidly. This capacity to achieve economies of scale further solidifies China's dominance in the EV sector. China has now become the world's largest EV manufacturing and sales market. 5 It's home to numerous EV manufacturers, including BYD, NIO, XPeng, and Geely. Modern EV companies like Tesla also have established manufacturing facilities in China. As per the statistics of the World Trade Organization which compared the global automotive exports market, there is a major shift in terms of the percentage of automotive exports of China in the last two decades. At the beginning of the 21 st century, the West and its allies dominated the list of the world’s top 10 automotive exporters with Europe leading the pack with 45.4% of the total exports. China, in 2000, had a partial share of 0.3% during that period. However, in 2022, while Europe has maintained its total percentage share, China’s percentage share of automotive exports has risen to a whopping 8% making it the fifth largest automobile exporter in the world. Related Article Friend-shoring battery supply chains Akhil Ramesh 20 June 2023 The country has also actively participated in setting technical standards related to EV technology, particularly in charging infrastructure and communication protocols. 6 By playing a leading role in establishing these standards, China has positioned itself to influence the global EV ecosystem. This ownership of standards provides a competitive advantage and makes it challenging for other countries to gain a significant foothold in the sector. China controls a significant portion of the global supply chain for key EV components, particularly rare earth elements and lithium-ion batteries. Its dominance in the extraction, processing, and production of rare earth materials and lithium batteries offers a unique advantage. This control over crucial elements of EV manufacturing grants China a strategic edge, as it ensures a consistent supply of essential materials. The Chinese government has shown a strong commitment to promoting the EV industry through domestic policies and investments in infrastructure. Substantial financial incentives, subsidies, and regulatory support have encouraged consumers and manufacturers to embrace electric vehicles. The development of charging infrastructure and research initiatives further solidify China's position as a global leader in the sector. EV market expansion and government support The EV market is poised for substantial growth, with projections indicating a rising share in the automotive sector. A Morgan Stanley report predicts that EVs will account for 26% of global car sales by 2030, surging to 72.2% by 2040 and around 81.5% by 2050. 7 Furthermore, market forecasts from Mordor Intelligence anticipate significant revenue growth in the EV sector, with predictions of a market size yielding US$725.14 billion by 2026, compared to US$171.26 billion in 2019. 8 This surge in EV adoption is further propelled by government regulations and climate goals. Numerous countries are introducing stringent regulations and incentives to accelerate the transition to cleaner transportation alternatives. For instance, the Dutch and Swedish governments plan to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, allowing only electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. 9 The UK has committed to banning new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030, with the aim of becoming entirely emissions-free by 2035. 10 France has set a target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, with strong governmental support through subsidies, tax credits, and interest-free loans. 11 These measures are expected to drive global EV adoption, reinforcing China's influence in the automotive sector. Related Article Critical minerals trade and the green energy transition Kristin Vekasi 18 July 2023 Competitive exports of Chinese-made EVs China’s approach to global EV industry domination involves investments in local assembly plants, supply chain integration, technology transfer, and government support to address transportation needs and environmental challenges while establishing China as a global leader in the EV industry. In developing economies across Asia, Latin America, and other regions, Chinese EV automakers are exporting affordable and diverse EV alternatives. 12 Simultaneously, Chinese EV manufacturers have made significant inroads in Western developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, and various European countries by exporting competitive, affordable EV alternatives. 13 Their diverse product offerings and rapid technological advancements have resonated with price-conscious consumers. These companies often expand into these markets with localized production and partnerships to navigate regulatory challenges. If challenges related to regulatory compliance, quality perception, and competition with established automakers can be addressed, it will further solidify China's role in the global automotive sector. One compelling case study highlighting China's rise in the EV industry is NIO Inc.'s success in Norway (and Europe broadly). 14 NIO, a Chinese EV manufacturer, entered the competitive Norwegian market with its electric SUVs, gaining a strong foothold due to competitive pricing and advanced technology. The company's plans to establish local manufacturing and collaborate with Norwegian partners to ensure better charging infrastructure and customer support made them a leader in the market. Following this success, the company also started operations in Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark in October last year. It provided consumers the option of buying online, from its stores or leasing the cars. Reports now say that the company is looking for dealers in the European market to drive up EV sales. China's growing influence is slowly growing in global EV markets as more countries transition to a climate-friendly automotive industry. This also illustrates the potential future dominance of EV manufacturers in the global automotive industry. The industry impact and the response China’s dominance has triggered intensified competition and innovation among traditional automakers worldwide, compelling them to invest in EV technology and design. 15 The country’s central role in the global supply chain for essential EV components, such as lithium-ion batteries and rare earth materials, underscores the need for diversification to mitigate dependency risks. 16 The exports of affordable EV alternatives have also expanded the global EV market, making cleaner transportation options accessible to a broader consumer base. However, this trend has also brought China's influence over EV technology to the forefront, shaping the industry's trajectory and potentially impacting global EV ecosystems. Recognizing China’s influence in this domain, countries that are traditional economic and geopolitical rivals are now pushing back against increasing Chinese presence in their domestic markets. A case in point is India which rejected BYD’s US$1 billion investment plan to build an EV and battery manufacturing plant in Hyderabad on security grounds. 17 Related Article Lithium is ‘new oil’ as electric vehicle market expands Andrea Durkin 21 September 2021 For traditional automotive-exporting countries, this shift presents both challenges and opportunities. They need to adjust their strategies, invest in EV production, and form partnerships to maintain their positions in an evolving automotive landscape. European countries which are major automotive manufacturers are trying to assess the best actions in countering China’s influence while adapting to the new EV-led automotive market in the near future. The Commission's decision to impose countervailing duties on EV imports from China aims to protect and bolster the competitiveness of the European auto industry. However, it's a delicate situation for the EU, as various member states have differing interests in the matter. Germany, which is heavily reliant on the Chinese market, is cautious about potential retaliation, while France sees this investigation as an opportunity to strengthen Europe's green technology sector. 18 The rise of China's dominance in the EV industry and its export strategies are fundamentally changing the operation of the global automotive landscape. While this brings both opportunities and challenges to the established automotive export players (and current EV competitors) they are ultimately pushing the industry towards a more sustainable mobility infrastructure that can benefit both the environment and consumers worldwide.

With advancements in technology, increasing environmental consciousness, and supportive government policies, EVs have gained significant traction as a viable and sustainable transportation option. As concerns over climate change and air pollution intensify, consumers and industries are increasingly turning to electric vehicles to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future. This growing global momentum has propelled the EV market into a transformative phase, with innovations and investments driving the expansion of EV adoption across the world. To know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report To know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure Electric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics: Driver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective Due to technological advancements and the production of EV batteries on a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade. Restraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure The initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time. Opportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors Increase in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022. Challenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE) The high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles. Market Ecosystem FCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period The FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. Mid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period A mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022. Thus, the demand for mid-priced EVs has been high in the past few years and is expected to keep rising in the coming decade. The market in the MEA is expected to grow at the highest rate in this segment as there is expected to be rising new demand in this region for these vehicles in the next decade. Asia Pacific to be the largest and the fastest growing market by value during the forecast period The region is home to some of the fastest-developing economies, such as China and India. The governments of these emerging economies have recognized the growth potential of the EV Market trends and, hence, have taken different initiatives to attract major OEMs to manufacture electric vehicles in domestic markets. The region is home to 93 of the world’s most polluted cities, and has a high energy demand. As of 2022, transportation sector in the region accounts for around 14% of overall emissions. Thus, countries in the region, are planning to reduce emissions in the coming years. China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022.

In this Deloitte report, we take a new approach to market segmentation and exemplify how to seize opportunities and manage risks. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shook up the automotive industry – along with every other industry – electric vehicles were moving steadily into the spotlight. The combined annual sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles tipped over the two-million-vehicle mark for the first time in 2019. This much-anticipated milestone may have become overshadowed by economic uncertainty and changed consumer priorities, but there is value in taking stock of the electric vehicle market even now.

Get the Deloitte Insights app Since Deloitte last presented a forecast for electric vehicle (EV) sales , in January 2019, the EV market has made great strides, and not just in terms of sales. OEMs have invested billions to deliver new electrified models, from R&D to factory redesign. Consumer attitudes have evolved. Government interventions have pushed forward and pulled back. But then COVID-19 completely disrupted global sales and manufacturing. In this context, a revised forecast based on updated data is needed. By examining the current state of the EV market worldwide and noting the many factors fostering growth in various directions (Part 1 of this report), we have formed conclusions about how the market will take shape over the next decade. The significant growth of EVs leading up to 2030 will present major opportunities and challenges for traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), new-entrant OEMs, captive finance companies and dealerships. In particular, traditional OEMs will find insights in this report that can help them re-prioritise their customers and strategies in a volatile competitive landscape. Paramount to seizing opportunities and managing risks is taking a new approach to market segmentation. We detail one such approach in Part 2 and apply it as a use case to one major market, the United Kingdom, to inform and inspire OEMs and other stakeholders globally. By letting today’s insights fuel the journey for the next ten years, we can accelerate beyond the obstacles the pandemic has brought and toward a future where EVs take centre stage. * In this report, we use the term electric vehicles (EVs) to refer to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 1 Unless specifically stated, our analysis has considered both forms of drivetrain. BEVs are powered solely by batteries. They use an electric motor to turn the wheels and produce zero emissions. PHEVs are capable of zero-emission driving, typically between 20 and 30 miles, and can run on petrol or diesel for longer trips. As the name suggests, they need to be plugged in to an electricity supply to maximise their zero-emission capability. Part 1 – Global progress and forecast The EV market’s collective accomplishments over the past two years offer hope, despite the short-term impact of COVID-19: a pattern of continued growth, which is expected to be sustained throughout the 2020s. As BEV and PHEV sales surpassed two million vehicles in 2019 (see figure 1), EVs staked their claim on a 2.5 per cent share of all new car sales last year. Looking back at BEVs in 2019, they accounted for 74 per cent of global EV sales: an increase of six percentage points since 2018. This rise was partly stimulated by new, stricter European emissions standards that persuaded manufacturers to favour the production and sale of zero-emission vehicles. Another factor is the advanced state of the BEV market in China, compared to the rest of the world. Although BEVs are still the dominant EV technology in the United States and Europe, they command a smaller share of the market than in China. Since the last time Deloitte reported on EV sales, significant regional disparities in growth have surfaced. For example, sales of EVs grew by 15 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by the growth of BEVs in Europe (+93 per cent), China (+17 per cent) and ‘other’ regions (+22 per cent). In contrast, the United States market for BEVs fell 2 per cent (see figure 1). Then, in the first half of 2020, COVID-19 slowed down the growth rate of EV sales, or sent it into decline, across various regions. The speed of recovery is expected to vary by region. But generally speaking, the course seems clear for growth over the next decade, despite the potential lasting impact of COVID-19 on total car sales over the next three years. To understand how things might continue, we need to understand what’s been taking place across the various regional markets over the past year. EVs in regional markets Europe Europe’s EV sector saw significantly more growth than other regions in 2019. The Nordics and the Netherlands continued to lead the way; Norway achieved 56 per cent market share, and two of the top ten best-selling cars in Holland were BEVs. 3 The United Kingdom and some other countries reported triple-digit growth for the year. Favourable government policies and a change in consumer attitudes were the catalysts, driven primarily by growing concerns about climate change. Climate change rose to the top of many European governments’ agendas. The United Kingdom committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and proposed a ban on the sale of all polluting vehicles by 2035. 4 Germany plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by the end of 2020, by 55 per cent by the end of 2030 and up to 95 per cent by the end of 2050, compared to 1990 levels. 5 Despite the growth seen in 2019, mainstream adoption of EVs has been, so far, hindered by the limited number of models available to the European market and consumer perceptions regarding insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions. 6 The outbreak of COVID-19 and national lockdown measures impacted total car sales in Europe, as showrooms closed their doors and manufacturers halted production, but EV sales have held up well in comparison to their internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents. In the first four months of 2020, in the European Union (EU), demand for new passenger cars contracted by 38.5 per cent, but in April 2020 – the first full month with COVID-19 restrictions in place – registrations of new passenger cars in the EU posted a year-on-year decline of 76.3 per cent, with some major markets reporting declines of over 95 per cent year-on-year. 7 But EV sales in Western Europe only fell by 31 per cent in April, with some countries actually reporting modest year-on-year growth – albeit against a low base. 8 China China continues to dominate the EV market, accounting for half of all vehicle sales. Sales in the second half of 2019 turned out lower than previously expected after some subsidies available to Chinese consumers were halved. 9 This considerably eroded the consumer demand for EVs, and total yearly sales dropped: PHEV sales fell by 9 per cent and BEV sales fell to a 17 per cent growth rate from 2018 to 2019. 10 On a positive note, a slowdown in the sales of ICE vehicles in the region means that the EV market share in China actually increased. China’s slowdown in the second half of 2019 affected global EV sales figures, but neither the slashed subsidies nor the impact of COVID-19 should impact EV sales significantly in the long term. Chinese authorities announced they would refrain from more subsidy cuts in 2020. 11 Meanwhile, other incentives (for example, number-plate privileges in Tier 1 cities) remain, investment is being made in China’s charging infrastructure and there is a continued focus on encouraging Chinese manufacturers to produce and market EVs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in place, China saw a 45 per cent decline in passenger car sales in Q1 2020. 12 EV sales fell at a faster rate than the total market (by 56 per cent), as consumers stayed home and showrooms closed their doors. 13 But the rate of recovery has been swift. By March 2020, Chinese factories had recovered to achieve a production rate of 75 per cent, with 86 per cent of employees returning to work. By April 2020, production had basically been restored to pre-pandemic levels. Although sales have remained depressed in certain Chinese provinces, recovery has been accelerated by pent-up demand, favourable policies put in place by Chinese authorities and the ability to purchase cars online; total sales actually reflected year-on-year growth in April. This brings hope for a ‘V-shaped’ recovery in China, with many individual EV manufacturers already benefitting from the release of new models. 14 United States After an encouraging start to 2019, falling fuel prices in the United States (a market that already enjoys comparatively cheap private transportation) led to a disappointing second half of the year for EV sales. The United States EV market is almost singlehandedly being carried by the success of the Tesla Model 3 – alone responsible for almost half of all EV sales. 15 As in Europe and China, United States car sales fell sharply in the first three months of 2020 as the pandemic took a toll on demand; job losses increased and large swathes of the population were ordered to stay home. The recovery in EV sales is likely to be slower in the United States than in other major regions, as manufacturers delay the launch of new cars and consumers take advantage of low oil prices. Rest of the world The world outside Europe, China and the United States is lagging behind in terms of EV sales, for various reasons: a lack of government commitment to EVs, insufficient or unsuitable charging infrastructure, unavailability of EVs and cultural differences regarding mobility models. For example, Japan is a major global car market, but new car sales are dominated by domestic OEMs that have not yet developed the same range of EVs as their European and Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, India, like many markets, is dominated by mass- and low-cost mobility models: an area that OEMs haven’t been able to penetrate so far, because of EVs’ comparative higher price. 2030 sales forecast With one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter. Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2) . Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term. Deloitte expects that by 2030 China will hold 49 per cent of the global EV market, Europe will account for 27 per cent, and the United States will hold 14 per cent. The share of new car sales taken up by EVs will vary considerably across markets (see figure 3). We forecast China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48 per cent by 2030 – almost double that of the United States (27 per cent), and Europe should achieve 42 per cent. But this doesn’t tell the whole story. Growth in Northern and Western Europe is expected to outstrip that in Southern and Eastern Europe as wealthier countries (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Nordic countries) likely invest more in infrastructure and offer greater cash and tax incentives to accelerate initial growth. EV growth beyond 2030 Beyond 2030, we expect the rate of growth in EV sales to slow. Some markets will be unable to support the transition to EVs in the same way that wealthier nations will over the next decade. Consider that, beyond 2030, one of the key factors in sustaining growth will be the implementation of suitable charging infrastructure. This requires multi-billion-dollar capital investments – achievable in some markets through a combination of public and private investment, but unlikely to be achieved uniformly around the world. In countries that cannot invest in charging infrastructure, we expect the market for ICE vehicles to remain for some time. Four factors driving growth Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. Factor 1 – Changing consumer sentiment Consumer demand will fuel the growth of EVs but, at the moment, there are several reasons consumers haven’t swapped their ICE vehicles for equivalent EVs. However, as the barriers to adoption are rapidly removed, EVs are increasingly becoming a realistic and viable option. Figure 4 shows how consumer concerns regarding BEVs have changed, and in many instances diminished, since 2018. From 2018 to 2020, there were some noticeable changes in consumer attitudes toward EVs. Concerns over the cost/price premium have diminished in every country apart from China (+ two percentage points), which has seen cuts in EV subsidies. Driving range has remained the number-one concern in Germany, and became number one in France, but there are now fewer consumers citing it as a concern in those two markets. Elsewhere, the lack of charging infrastructure has become the top priority for consumers, reflecting the possibility that they are starting to see EVs as a realistic option and are considering the practicalities of ownership. Over the next few years, we expect some barriers to be completely removed. EVs’ driving range is already comparable to that of ICE vehicles; price has already reached parity, if you consider subsidies in various markets and total cost of ownership; and the number of models available is increasing. As EV sales continue to grow and consumers see more of them on the roads, or travel in EVs owned by family or friends, we expect personal experiences to trump concerns. The expected proliferation of commercial EVs (such as vans, trucks, lorries) should also play a part in reassurance, as will the rise of mass-transit options (such as electric buses). Measures that governments take in their COVID-19 recovery plans could also affect consumer sentiment. As part of a $146 billion economic recovery plan, Germany has designated $2.8 billion to EV charging infrastructure and announced new legislation that will oblige all fuel stations to have an EV charging point. 19 This is significant progress in a country where driving range and lack of charging infrastructure are the two biggest barriers for consumers. China has made similar commitments, announcing an additional $378 million investment in charging infrastructure as part of a COVID-19 recovery plan. 20 Factor 2 – Policy and legislation Government intervention continues to play an important role in driving EV sales, as shown by the successes in Norway, fluctuating sales in the Netherlands and changing fortunes of the Chinese EV market. 21 Not only are there economic benefits for states that support a transition to electric, but the positive environmental impact has made the widespread adoption of EVs a necessary step toward achieving climate-change goals, such as those of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Several policies and regulations are helping encourage the growth of EV adoption: Fuel economy and emission targets These differ across markets and are under constant review and consultation by governments. Recent Deloitte analysis shows that with the phasing-in of new European CO 2 emission targets, which will be fully implemented in 2021 and bring punitive fines, 22 half of car manufacturers are facing related penalty payments. They’ll owe a total of $0.5 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2021, 23 which could cost the industry approximately $39 billion, based on recent emission levels. 24 Such government intervention is shaping OEM strategy: to avoid fines and reputational fallout, OEMs are seeking ways to reduce emissions through increased electrification. City access restrictions City governments have led the way on imposing bans, or punitive taxes, on users of older combustion engines, addressing increasing concerns about toxic air pollution.  In 2019 more cities followed the path already taken in Madrid, Mexico City, Rome and Seattle: Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona all took action to reduce the number of ICE vehicles on the road. Several United Kingdom cities also brought forward plans for bans and zero-/low-emission zones. Throughout 2020 we expect this trend to continue as cities worldwide grapple with air pollution and confront their relationships with combustion engines – and private cars in general. Financial incentives Many governments have offered compelling financial incentives to make the electric switch, such as providing cash subsidies to consumers buying low-emission vehicles, reducing taxes on EVs and increasing or maintaining taxes on ICE vehicles. But as EVs reach price parity with ICE vehicles, some governments have explored rolling back such incentives; this can have a dramatic and immediate effect on EV sales, as seen by the recent fluctuations in sales in China and the Netherlands. Instead, in light of COVID-19, the need to stimulate total new car purchases has prompted a range of new financial incentives introduced across major markets, some of which clearly favour EVs. For example, in Germany the government has temporarily lowered VAT from 19 per cent to 16 per cent on low-emission vehicles and doubled existing subsidies to almost $7,000 on EVs costing less than $45,000. 25 In France, private consumers who buy electric cars (that cost up to $50,000) now receive an almost $8,000 incentive, up from around $7,000; those looking to get rid of their old cars now receive double the previous value offered by a scrappage scheme, which was designed to get less-efficient models off the road. 26 Under both schemes, a consumer replacing an older car for a new EV could be eligible for up to $13,500. Meanwhile, in China, EV subsidies and tax break policies set to expire in 2020 were extended to 2022 in a direct response to the economic impact of COVID-19. 27 In the long term, the viability of financial incentives will need to be reconsidered as the economic recovery from the pandemic becomes clearer and governments try to manage other concerns, such as potential lost fuel-tax revenues. Factor 3 – OEM vehicle strategy In the past year, some prominent OEMs have announced strategic commitments to EVs (see figure 5). New models have been announced, production targets increased and sales targets moved forward and multiplied. In the short term, COVID-19 may hinder some OEMs in their reach for these targets, as they conserve cash and divert investments elsewhere in the business. But in the long term, we expect these targets to continue as priorities for OEMs. The impact of the investment and targets shown in figure 5 will represent a seismic market shift over the next decade, in terms of availability and affordability of models. Availability of models Recent company announcements have made it clear that there will be substantially more EV models commercially available over the next decade than previously thought. According to statistics cited by the European Federation for Transport and Environment, Europe should expect 33 new models in 2020, 22 in 2021, 30 in 2022 and 33 in 2023. 29 This means that BEV models available in the EU will surpass 100 in 2022 and reach 172 in 2025. In the United States, IHS Markit predicts there will be 130 available models by 2026, offered by 43 brands. 30 Affordability of models Achieving price parity with, or even savings over, ICE vehicles will play a big role in speeding up EV adoption, especially as model ranges and marketing priorities adapt to manufacturer emission targets. A key takeaway from monthly sales figures in 2019 is just how sensitive consumers are to the relative total cost of ownership when it comes to EVs versus ICE vehicles. This includes upfront costs (as seen in the Chinese EV sales drop when subsidies were cut) and short-term costs, like fuel (as seen in the United States, where EV sales dipped right along with fuel prices). Based on recent company announcements, over the next decade we expect to see EVs – particularly BEVs – become available at the low-cost end of the market, but the roll-out of EVs across all parts of the market is likely to be uneven. Even with more OEMs offering affordable EV models, consumers are still unwilling to pay a premium for an EV instead of its ICE equivalent. However, we expect the existing price premium associated with EVs to be consigned to history sooner rather than later. In some cases, the total cost of owning a BEV or PHEV for private buyers is already less than for the ICE equivalent, and the annual cost of ownership is also balancing out. Meanwhile, for businesses and customers that use company car schemes, favourable tax schemes have already created an environment where EVs can offer savings. Factor 4 – The role of corporate companies We are seeing an increasingly important role for corporates to support the transition to EVs, using the three factors highlighted above to their advantage. Sales of new cars to businesses represents a significant proportion of all cars sold. For instance, Deloitte previously predicted that corporates would account for 63 per cent of total new car sales across Western Europe by 2021. 31 In the past year, purpose has continued rising to the top of the corporate agenda, with an increasing number of companies seeking to differentiate themselves by acting as a force for positive change. Because travel is a major avenue for businesses to alleviate emissions, more and more companies are considering how they can support a shift to EVs. Traditional company car schemes are ripe for reinvention: By exploring broader mobility options, businesses are finding value not just in emissions reduction, but in cost savings and improved employee satisfaction. Government tax schemes that target company cars put the emphasis firmly on businesses to lead the way in the shift to EVs. In light of COVID-19, investment in fleets has stalled dramatically as corporates reduce their expenditure and prioritise other investments. Before a comprehensive transition to EVs can take place, business confidence needs to be restored and funds made available again. Corporates also need to consider how fundamental changes to how and where work is done will affect the structure of their mobility schemes. Part 2: New landscape, new approach In our previous report, we identified unprecedented levels of competition that threatened incumbent OEMs as the shift to EVs began taking shape. 32 That threat has reduced somewhat over the past year as those OEMs doubled down on their investment in the sector, and as the reality of competing in the automotive industry hit home for new market entrants. In China, for instance, 486 registered EV manufacturers have raised over $18 billion in funding since 2011, but their collective manufacturing capacity is unsustainable – considering all reasonable sales forecasts. 33 As a result, we expect to see consolidation of the market; some new entrants will fail, and the number of partnerships and joint ventures between Chinese manufacturers and Western OEMs will rise. Outside China, many established OEMs are actually investing in start-ups to take advantage of the capabilities they’ve built. 34 Despite the marginal decline in the threat from new entrants and start-ups, there hasn’t been a consistent speed at which incumbent OEMs have reacted to, and planned for, the growth of EVs. The ability of some manufacturers to swiftly accommodate the future of EVs, and trade in their traditional approaches for creative thinking, means that the competitive landscape will likely re-arrange itself accordingly. Segmenting the market In an increasingly competitive marketplace, all automotive industry stakeholders – established OEMs, new entrants, captive finance houses and dealerships, for example – should consider how they can convince consumers to purchase an EV – or, specifically, their EV. The obvious choices are to ensure current customers remain loyal during the transition from ICE to EV, or to convert new customers to an EV brand or product. A valuable exercise to achieve either objective (or both) is through a refreshed customer segmentation approach: Targeting consumers by their behaviour and needs. In the sections that follow, we’ve used the United Kingdom as a use case for market segmentation, based on Monitor Deloitte’s GrowthPath ® Action Segmentation ® . 35 Although there are significant differences worldwide when it comes to the structure of the automotive industry, the retail market, the readiness for EV adoption and consumer attitudes and behaviours, the principles of segmentation outlined below can be applied to many major markets. For those where they cannot, the central tenet remains true: Refreshing your consumer segmentation approach can benefit EV sales, stimulating the overall growth of the market. Use case: United Kingdom In November 2019 Deloitte conducted a survey of 1,496 United Kingdom residents who are thinking of buying a car in the next three years. More than half of respondents were considering an EV – significantly more than those considering a petrol or diesel car (35 per cent). But their intention doesn’t mean an automatic conversion into purchases. Although sales of EVs in the United Kingdom are rising, BEVs and PHEVs combined still only commanded a 3.1 per cent share of the market in 2019. 36 It’s clear that there is an opportunity here to put consumers under the microscope, discerning certain characteristics that will aid in market segmentation and boost EV conversion. Our goal of meaningful and actionable segmentation begins with the United Kingdom survey results: Based on the opinions of these buyers, we can create a segmentation framework based on driving behaviour and a mix of consumer and demographic variables (see figure 6). In the United Kingdom, the most prominent differences in behaviour and attitudes identified in our survey were determined by how old a consumer is, how much they spend each month and whether they currently own a car or not. Behaviour and attitudes also varied significantly, based on how respondents plan on using their next car and the distances they regularly travel. From the framework, we can see nine potential segments that can categorise future car buyers, all with various meaningful characteristics, behaviours and needs to target and address (see figure 7). To calculate an approximate market size for each segment, a recent industry study offers insight: 56 per cent of adults (17 years and older) believe they will definitely or probably purchase a car in the next three years – a total addressable market of about 30 million people. 38 * Using the annual average GBP/USD exchange rate for 2019, <£299/month = <$382/month and +£300/month = +£383/month Key behavioural differences This kind of segmentation provides a detailed understanding of modern automotive consumers’ needs, wants and behaviours. Before defining the nuances of each United Kingdom segment by creating Customer Portraits®, let’s consider the obvious differences in key behaviours and attitudes: Brand loyalty: Segments E and G are the most brand loyal, usually buying the same brand (47 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, versus the average 27 per cent); this translates to their intended purchasing behaviour – both types of consumer believe they would buy an EV from their current brand (48 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively, versus the average 37 per cent). Segments F and I are most likely to consider switching brands to find a more suitable EV (47 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, versus the average 36 per cent). Segment A is most likely to consider choosing either an EV start-up brand (42 per cent versus the average 25 per cent) or an existing brand not currently associated with automotive products (12 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Research: Segment E is most likely to already know what car they intend to buy prior to researching (50 per cent versus the average 28 per cent). Segment A and Segment I are the least likely to know (40 per cent each versus the average 26 per cent). Ownership benefits: Segment B is the most likely to think environmental reasons are the biggest advantage to EVs (22 per cent versus the average 17 per cent). Segment A considers driving experience to be the biggest advantage (36 per cent versus the average 27 per cent). Price sensitivity: Most segments would pay more for an EV. Segment E is the most likely to pay £100 ($128) or more per month (15 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Segments F and I are the least likely to pay more for an EV (28 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, versus the average 23 per cent). These characteristics are worthy of careful consideration in the next step of the segmentation exercise: building Customer Portraits. Customer Portraits: Driving a change in behaviour Building a Customer Portrait for each target segment invites insights into key aspects of a consumer that, when viewed collectively, explain their behaviour. It outlines what they do and why they do it, identifying the motives for, and barriers to, behavioural change – or lack thereof. Ultimately, this allows an OEM, captive finance company or dealership to effectively target and encourage desired behaviours by revising marketing and activation strategies. A detailed analysis of survey responses and additional qualitative research informs the individual profiles. Each illustrates a typical consumer in a segment, defines their key characteristics, and then uses the distilled information to present ways that persona can be specifically targeted. As an example, we built three Customer Portraits for segments of United Kingdom–based consumers, complete with suggested actions for OEMs. Prioritise to drive purchases Having developed these nuanced Customer Portraits, OEMs and other stakeholders can drill down into the observations to draw conclusions about who is likely to buy what. This will highlight segments to prioritise and where marketing and proposition development budgets can be deployed most effectively. Some segments are naturally more interested in purchasing an EV than others; OEMs and their partners may look to target them first – if the right product mix, capabilities and insight are available to do so effectively. In our United Kingdom example (see figure 8), Segment G is the most likely to consider buying an EV (69 per cent versus the average 50 per cent) – perhaps not surprising, given the relatively higher price tag of EVs up to this point and the greater likelihood of those consumers having off-street parking (77 per cent versus the average 72 per cent). Segment C is also significantly more likely than other segments to consider an EV, but these consumers’ motives seemingly relate to the distance they regularly travel and their awareness of potential ownership savings (e.g., through lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance costs). The impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour Deloitte’s segmentation of the United Kingdom market was performed prior to the emergence of COVID-19. It is important to consider how shifting priorities, in light of the pandemic, may affect the different segments. In the United Kingdom, lockdown measures took consumers out of the automotive retail market for an extended period of time. Even as restrictions are eased, financial concerns may shape how people re-engage with the sector, and to what extent. Lingering health concerns will likely also play a pivotal role in consumer behaviour. Short-term demand for EVs is likely to change, within and across segments. According to consumer research carried out by Deloitte bi-weekly, throughout the pandemic, close to half of United Kingdom consumers now plan to own their current vehicles for longer than originally intended. 42 (The number of consumers aged 18 to 34, or 55 and over, who expressed this sentiment is marginally lower than other age groups.) With work travel being a key component of our segmentation, it is also worth considering how COVID-19 is changing how we travel to and for work. The recent research highlights that over two-thirds of consumers plan to limit their use of public transportation in the future, and well over half plan to limit their use of ride-sharing apps. In the short term, this will likely accelerate demand for cheap second-hand cars, but in the long term this could translate into increased demand for EVs within Segment A. COVID-19 might also prove to be a catalyst for the growth of online sales within different segments. Our COVID-19–related research shows that a fifth of consumers now plan to buy their next vehicle online (if possible). This figure is consistently higher among 18- to 34-year-olds, suggesting that Segments B, C, D and E could all demonstrate a significant jump in demand for online services. Checklist for the journey ahead Ultimately, it’s up to all stakeholders in the automotive industry to consider how they can best serve their prioritised segments. Consumer interest has been sparked, and the onus now lies with new-entry OEMs, captive finance companies, dealerships and, especially, established OEMs to feed the fire. To maximise the opportunities presented by the growing demand for EVs, business leaders in all regions should examine the priorities they have defined according to the segmentation exercise and ask themselves the key questions shown below. The answers may help soften the blow COVID-19 is making on the market and/or aid in the recovery. They’ll also highlight how well-positioned the business is to help accelerate growth in the EV market and reap the benefits when EVs take centre stage. Established OEMs: How well does our existing model range fit the segments we deem high priority, and on which segments should we focus future models? Do we have the right EV supply chains and order-to-delivery capabilities to realise our promises to customers, especially in the initial launch phase? Can we support, or even drive, change in our franchised dealerships by delivering more compelling in-store EV marketing and increasing model availability? How do we make sure that our franchised dealers are aligned with our EV strategy? How can we incentivise them to sacrifice the long-term, recurring profit of an ICE vehicle sale to support the growth of EVs? How well does our current branding support new EV model (and broader proposition) launches? Do we have the right marketing and campaign approaches to target specific segments? Do we have sufficient in-house capabilities, or the right partnerships, to offer a compelling charging proposition? How do we improve our current omni-channel experience? What innovative retail formats, online and bricks and mortar, should we invest in? New-entrant OEMs: Some consumer segments will be identified as ‘easier wins’ to build brand and customer intimacy, so how can our product launch plans target these most effectively? How can new business models, unconstrained by legacy IT systems and physical footprints, provide an enhanced customer experience as compared to traditional OEMs? Will Chinese new entrants need different strategies for launching in Europe? How will we continue to engage with customers after a purchase, to receive product feedback and incorporate it into a refreshed sales strategy? How will we manage the after-sales business without established dealer networks? Are there additional partners that could support market entry and offer a more compelling value proposition, such as energy providers? Captive finance companies: Which financing offers will appeal to which segment? What is the best way to manage the wave of incoming ICE vehicles and realise the expected residuals on these? Which finance solutions will address customers’ apprehension about switching (e.g., combined vehicle and wallbox-charger financing, or social offers, like cinema tickets)? Do we have a compelling offering for our fleet customers to gain regulatory and tax benefits? How can our marketing convincingly address ‘range anxiety’ and other barriers to EV ownership? Do we have the capability to understand and act on existing EV customers’ feedback and learnings to strengthen our retention programmes? Dealerships: Can we effectively communicate the benefits of EVs to our customers? Do we understand which segments want to learn about environmental benefits and which are exclusively interested in technology and performance? Do we have the assets to support a more targeted approach to marketing? Do we offer a financially compelling reason to switch to EVs while maintaining an appropriate margin on the vehicles? Can we fully explain all the available government grants and financial packages available for EVs? Can we offer ongoing maintenance and service packages or deals that include funding for at-home charge points? Is our business set up to handle an increase in online sales? Can we offer collection and delivery services? Can we provide test drives to online customers? Can we use our existing regional footprint to effectively fulfil online sales? Is our business set up to deal with the potential loss of recurring revenue (after-sales service and parts)? Are our marketing and sales strategies fully aligned with those of our OEM partners?

Impact of technology advancement in EV market and competition in EV market,https://bolt.earth/blog/ev-landscape-in-china,"China's EV Market: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Scope ...","China’s EV Market: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Scope - Bolt Earth Platform Solutions Products Company Enquire Now Platform Solutions Products Company Enquire Now Our Blog China’s EV Market: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Scope China’s EV Market: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Scope Raghav Bharadwaj Head of Strategy and Leadership August 31, 2023 Over the last decade, China has led the race to transition to electric vehicles (EVs). It has been so successful that other countries have made immense progress by adopting its formula: a combination of significant capital investment and a centralized, interventionist approach. This strategy has successfully boosted EV adoption by supporting not only manufacturing, but also nationwide infrastructure development. China has encouraged the potential of its EV market by gradually introducing financial subsidies in many cities. Thanks to substantial reserves of raw materials for batteries, continuous technological advances, increasingly widespread charging infrastructure, and export efforts by EV manufacturers, China’s EV momentum keeps accelerating. This article will address the following questions: What is the current state of China's EV market, and how is the market share distributed among different vehicle types and commercial EV OEMs? What potential challenges affect the Chinese EV market, and how do they impact EV adoption? How do governmental policies, incentives, and national targets support the growth and development of China’s EV market? China’s Current EV Market As one of the leaders in the EV world, China has successfully expanded its global market share from less than 30% in 2019 to 41.5% in 2022. Its role as the largest EV production base is even stronger, with 7.1 million units , representing 70% of the 2022 global total, made in China. Within China, EV sales have increased from 16% of the domestic car market in 2021, to 29%, or 6.9 million vehicles, in 2022. The market is segmented into battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Battery EVs (BEVs) made up nearly 77.9% of sales in 2022. Moreover, there was a remarkable 151.9% YoY surge in plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) sales. Currently, passenger cars are more popular than commercial vehicles, accounting for 95.1% of EV sales. The commercial vehicles sector is on the verge of widespread EV adoption, however; more than 30 cities are planning to fully electrify their public transit systems by 2028. China also dominates the electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler markets. As of 2021, it had 93 million electric two-wheelers, thanks in part to a 2019 technical standard favoring lithium ion batteries. Domestic companies Yadea and Aima account for the majority of lower-end electric scooter sales, followed by Nio. Meanwhile, electric 3-wheelers are popular for goods and service deliveries, accounting for about 90% of urban last-mile deliveries . The Chinese EV market is projected to continue growing , with an estimated revenue of US $292.1 billion in 2023, and a CAGR of 6.38% from 2023 to 2028. It remains competitive; more than 94 brands offer a total of over 300 EV models at various price points. Domestic brands like BYD lead, with an 81% share , while startups like Xpeng and Nio further intensify competition, solidifying China's EV production dominance. Like other countries with major EV markets, China is rapidly expanding its EV charging infrastructure; as of August 2022, it accounted for 65% of global public charging points. In May of 2022, China added 87,000 new charging stations, reaching a total of 1.419 million stations. China aims for a ratio of 14.66 charging points per vehicle by 2025. Major 4W Market Players China's domestic EV industry is well-developed, with many established manufacturers and an extensive supply chain. This has allowed Chinese companies to produce EVs at a competitive cost, making them attractive to consumers from other countries. Foreign-brand joint ventures, as well as foreign brands such as Tesla with manufacturing facilities in China, have further contributed to the growth of China’s EV export industry. Some Chinese firms, like Geely, also own foreign-based subsidiaries. Major EV Fleets China’s fleet market is segmented into government firms, state-owned businesses, public services, taxis, and long-term rental companies. In keeping with policy interventions, government and state-owned firms feature lower transaction prices, smaller engines, and increased use of domestic brands, with a mandate for 30% EV adoption. E-buses and e-trucks are flourishing, constituting over 90% of the global e-bus market in 2021. Top 10 e-truck and e-bus manufacturers hold 70% and 85% market share , demonstrating consolidation through economies of scale. Major cities like Shenzhen, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, and Tangshan are experiencing high adoption of electric buses and trucks, due to policy-driven preferences. About 9.5% of conventional taxis were electric in 2020, and China’s 14th Five-Year Plan aims for 35% EV representation in the taxi fleet by 2025, with local targets in place. China has two types of taxis: conventional taxis hailed on the streets, and taxis ordered via apps. Around 9.5% of conventional taxis were electric in 2020 , and the 14th Five-Year Plan aims for EVs to represent 35% of the taxi fleet by 2025. Accordingly, many cities have set local targets for taxi fleet electrification. Potential Challenges in the Chinese EV Market Thanks to strong government support, China has emerged as a major driving force in the global EV transition. However, China still faces challenges involving making local EV brands more competitive, securing the supply chain for raw materials, and expanding charging infrastructure. Transitioning from Subsidies to Market-Driven Demand The Chinese government has significantly contributed to EV demand. However, in an attempt to stimulate organic consumer demand, the government gradually canceled subsidies between 2020 and 2022. As a result, battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales temporarily rose as customers rushed to make purchases while subsidies were still in effect, but have since slowed . This decline may not turn out to be a major concern, however; EV manufacturers show signs of successfully adapting to focus on diverse consumer needs in the absence of subsidies. Competition and Market Consolidation Intense price competition among 40 carmakers in China led to unprecedented cuts in vehicle prices, negatively impacting gross margins for domestic brands in Q1 2022. Generally speaking, China domestic brands’ gross margin dropped 19% in Q1 of 2022 compared with the previous quarter. In January 2023, Tesla reduced Model 3 and Model Y prices by between 6% to 13.5% , which caused another round of price wars in the domestic market. Trade conflicts and battery resource costs may further erode margins. As a result, Chinese EV businesses are seeking opportunities abroad . This may come with its own set of obstacles, however, such as other countries’ local protectionism. Battery Technology and Supply Chain Issues Unevenly distributed reserves of raw materials may put the supply chain at risk. China holds a dominant position in global graphite mining, accounting for 82% of the market share and owning nearly 25% of the world's graphite reserves in 2022. However, it has only a 1% share in cobalt mining and reserves. This imbalance poses a risk to the EV battery supply chain; rising costs of battery materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium could increase battery prices, potentially affecting consumer demand for EVs. Low self-sufficiency in batteries, electric motors, and power semiconductors may pose further problems. Subscribe to our Newsletter Stay up to date with our latest news. Submit Government Incentives & National EV Targets The Chinese government has been a driving force behind the EV industry, implementing supportive policies for R&D, manufacturing, and marketing since the 1990s. These policies include consumer subsidies, sectoral plans, technical standards, tax credits, and charging infrastructure strategies, as well as the “dual credit” system. Local implementation is fundamentally guided by the same central policies, but varies due to China's diverse political economies and unique circumstances. EV Master Plan: Made in China 2025 China's “Made in China 2025” plan is a national strategy which targets 20% EV sales by 2025. China already surpassed this figure in 2022. In 2020, China published the New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021 – 2035) as a top-level policy to guide the comprehensive integration of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). The plan involves four principles : market-led development, innovation-driven development, coordinated promotion, and open development. By 2025, China envisions a more competitive EV market, while 2035 sees EVs reaching global standards and advanced charging infrastructure. China has also proposed comprehensive targets to guide the development of battery and charging infrastructure. The 14th Five-Year Plan prioritizes strategic emerging industries , particularly involving new energy vehicles and batteries; the policy emphasizes EV manufacturing, battery R&D, and nano ion battery industry development. Meanwhile, a January 2022 announcement revealed plans to establish 20 million EV charging facilities by 2025 . Recently, the State Council set five major targets to create a high-quality charging infrastructure system by 2030, aiming for extensive coverage, moderate scale, balanced structure, and optimal functionality to support the growing EV market. EV Supply-Side Incentives Research, Development, and Tax Subsidies Both state and city governments provide support for researching and developing EV-related technology. For example, as part of China’s Five-Year Plan, the central government offers special funds for innovation, demonstration projects, and application promotion, whereas local governments allocate matching funds for infrastructure and battery recycling . Meanwhile, companies and institutions engaged in EV development are exempt from business tax. Since China bases its passenger car taxation system on average fuel consumption, EV users also benefit from tax relief. China’s vehicle purchase tax — a one-time tax that is paid when a new vehicle is purchased — is a significant cost, which can be up to 10% of the vehicle's purchase price. Exemption from this tax is a major incentive for EV adoption in China. It makes EVs more affordable for consumers, and it helps to promote the use of cleaner transportation. Manufacturing Support In addition to implementing conventional policies and providing financial support, China utilizes a credit system to boost EV production. The International Council for Clean Transportation sets gradually increasing sales targets for domestic auto manufacturers, and enables flexible compliance through carbon-credit trading. Now that sales have surpassed the current 18% benchmark , the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology plans to set higher targets for the future. Technology Development Funds To support the EV industry, the government encourages financial institutions to provide credit reviews and diversified financing options to EV manufacturers. EV Demand-Side Incentives Purchase Subsidies and Tax Incentives To promote EV adoption, the Chinese government offers purchase grants through central and local rules, granting subsidies of up to RMB 100,000 (approximately USD $15,000) per vehicle. These subsidies are reported to be the second most generous in the world, following Norway. The government further supports electric vehicle sales by offering 2023 tax exemptions on purchases of
new energy vehicles. Charging Infrastructure The Chinese government provides dedicated charging infrastructure subsidies to local governments that meet promotion targets. State Grid and China Southern Power Grid offer favorable treatment to charging station operators, exempting them from ""basic charges"" based on electricity usage. The basic charge is a predetermined charge based on the capacity of transformers used by significant industrial electricity consumers. Driving and Parking Privileges In some cities, like Nanjing and Shanghai, EVs are allowed to bypass traffic congestion by using bus lanes. Several cities are also encouraging public institutions to provide designated EV parking spots , including chargers. Public Bus Policies Subsidies and benefits for low-emission public bus fleets contribute to China's optimistic outlook for EV development. The government has provided local governments with annual bus electrification targets, and penalizes noncompliance by reducing oil subsidies, thereby promoting EV bus adoption by increasing operating costs for traditional buses. Opportunities for Future Growth China's significant domestic market and well-established technological competitiveness have already positioned it as a top player in the global EV market. With its commitment to achieving net-zero targets by 2060, China is ready to take advantage of new opportunities to further amplify its role in the electric revolution. Promoting Investment for Sustainable Market-Driven Demand The gradual end of financial subsidies may have short-term negative effects on the demand for EVs. The government could counter this potential downturn by providing different or non-financial incentives, such as free license plates, right of way privileges, or tax exemptions. China could also compensate for the subsidy discontinuations by taking steps to further stimulate its domestic market. For example, it could make EVs more appealing by focusing on research and development to enhance battery technology, charging infrastructure, and autonomous driving capabilities. As a matter of fact, starting from 2009, subsidies for the EV industry primarily manifested as conventional R&D grants, often channeled through established programs like the long-standing high-tech "" 863 Program ."" Alternatively, it could make EVs more affordable by implementing measures to scale up EV production, optimize the supply chain, and encourage local manufacturing to reduce production costs. An even stronger target for phasing out ICEs might also be beneficial. Right now, only Hainan Province has announced a complete ban on ICE in the private vehicle sector by 2030; other cities or provinces could follow suit. Creating an equal investment environment for foreign enterprises entering the Chinese market is also essential. Supportive Infrastructure Development Due to the increasing number of EVs, China finds itself tackling the challenge of meeting the growing demand for charging infrastructure. China is planning to add over 600,000 charging points in 2023 , and to introduce ultra-fast charging stations with 120 – 350 kW capacity. To further strengthen its charging infrastructure, China could attract more investments, and encourage joint ventures. It will also need to focus on expanding infrastructure to inland cities; over 70% of existing charging stations are in coastal areas. Technological Advancements and Innovation China's thriving EV landscape is partially due to battery innovation, which has enabled the country to surpass its 2025 targets in range and energy consumption. The time is now ripe to implement a new technology target. For example, China could seize the chance to become a leader in achieving better graphite quality for battery production. Alternatively, it could focus on advancements in AI. Start-ups like Nio are already innovating new features in the premium EV market. China could further accelerate its EV technology and boost its competitive edge by forming joint ventures with, and further opening the market to, global players. Electrification of Public Transportation and Commercial Fleets China is strongly committed to achieving 100% electrification of its public transportation system, with many major cities setting clear timelines for this target. By rapidly adopting EV buses , China can open the door to significant advancements in fleet maintenance and management, and can go on to successfully implement smart city strategies. For example, a centralized system utilizing advanced algorithms to analyze electric bus operations and energy consumption data could efficiently optimize fleet scheduling by monitoring performance and predicting passenger flow. China’s Electric Future China leads the global electric vehicle market, thanks to strong government support, improved technology, growing environmental awareness, and commitment to smart city strategies. Battery EVs dominate sales, and China’s net-zero targets drive continuous investment in research and development. Despite challenges involving transitioning from subsidies to market-driven demand, handling intense price competition, and securing raw materials, China is on the verge of exploring opportunities to promote sustainable demand, develop charging infrastructure, and advance battery technology. With coordination among policymakers, manufacturers, and innovators, China can win the market in the long-term with its thriving and dynamic EV industry.

This paper reviews the advances of EVs regarding battery technology trends, charging methods, as well as new research challenges and open opportunities. More specifically, an analysis of the worldwide market situation of EVs and their future prospects is carried out. Given that one of the fundamental aspects in EVs is the battery, the paper presents a thorough review of the battery technologies—from the Lead-acid batteries to the Lithium-ion. Moreover, we review the different standards that are available for EVs charging process, as well as the power control and battery energy management proposals. Finally, we conclude our work by presenting our vision about what is expected in the near future within this field, as well as the research aspects that are still open for both industry and academic communities. Keywords: Electric Vehicles ; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle ; battery charging ; batteries technology ; charging modes ; EV plugs 1. Introduction The automotive industry has become one of the most important world-wide industries, not only at economic level, but also in terms of research and development. Increasingly, there are more technological elements that are being introduced on the vehicles towards the improvement of both passengers and pedestrians’ safety. In addition, there is a greater number of vehicles on the roads, which allows for us to move quickly and comfortably. However, this has led to a dramatic increase in air pollution levels in urban environments (i.e., pollutants, such as PM, nitrogen oxides (NO X ), CO, sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), etc.). In addition, and according to a report by the European Union, the transport sector is responsible for nearly 28% of the total carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, while the road transport is accountable for over 70% of the transport sector emissions [ 1 ]. Therefore, the authorities of most developed countries are encouraging the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to avoid the concentration of air pollutants, CO 2 , as well as other greenhouse gases. More specifically, they promote sustainable and efficient mobility through different initiatives, mainly through tax incentives, purchase aids, or other special measures, such as free public parking or the free use of motorways. EVs offer the following advantages over traditional vehicles: Zero emissions: this type of vehicles neither emit tailpipe pollutants, CO 2 , nor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Also, the manufacture processes tend to be more respectful with the environment, although battery manufacturing adversely affects carbon footprint. Simplicity: the number of Electric Vehicle (EV) engine elements is smaller, which leads to a much cheaper maintenance. The engines are simpler and more compact, they do not need a cooling circuit, and neither is necessary for incorporating gearshift, clutch, or elements that reduce the engine noise. Reliability: having less, and more simple, components makes this type of vehicles have fewer breakdowns. In addition, EVs do not suffer of the inherent wear and tear produced by engine explosions, vibrations, or fuel corrosion. Cost: the maintenance cost of the vehicle and the cost of the electricity required is much lower in comparison to maintenance and fuel costs of traditional combustion vehicles. The energy cost per kilometer is significantly lower in EVs than in traditional vehicles, as shown in Figure 1 . Comfort: traveling in EVs is more comfortable, due to the absence of vibrations or engine noise [ 2 ]. Efficiency: EVs are more efficient than traditional vehicles. However, the overall well to wheel (WTW) efficiency will also depend on the power plant efficiency. For instance, total WTW efficiency of gasoline vehicles ranges from 11% to 27%, whereas diesel vehicles range from 25% to 37% [ 3 ]. By contrast, EVs fed by a natural gas power plant show a WTW efficiency that ranges from 13% to 31%, whereas EVs fed by renewable energy show an overall efficiency up to 70%. Accessibility: this type of vehicle allows for access to urban areas that are not allowed to other combustion vehicles (e.g., low emissions zones). EVs do not suffer from the same traffic restrictions in large cities, especially at high peaks of contamination level. Interestingly, there was a recent OECD study that suggests that, at least in terms of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, EVs will unfortunately not improve the air quality situation [ 4 ]. On the other hand, EVs do, however, face significant battery-related challenges: Driving range: range is typically limited from 200 to 350 km with a full charge, although this issue is being continually improved. For example, the Nissan Leaf has a maximum driving range of 364 km [ 6 ], and the Tesla Model S can reach more than 500 km [ 7 ]. Charging time: full charging the battery pack can take 4 to 8 h. Even a “fast charge” to 80% capacity can take 30 min. For example, Tesla superchargers can charge the Model S up to 50% in only 20 min, or 80% in half an hour [ 7 ]. Battery cost: large battery packs are expensive. Bulk and weight: battery packs are heavy and take up considerable vehicle space. It is assumed that the batteries of this type of vehicles have an approximate weight of 200 kg [ 8 ], which can vary, depending on the battery capacity. In the coming years, EVs will have a very important role in Smart cities, along with shared mobility, public transport, etc. Therefore, more efforts to facilitate the charging process and to improve batteries are needed. The main drawback of the EVs is their autonomy. However, researchers are working on improved battery technologies to increase driving range and decrease charging time, weight, and cost. These factors will ultimately determine the future of EVs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of EV technologies, charging modes, and the research carried out by different research teams and labs. Figure 2 depicts the main topics that are presented in the paper. Overall, the insight and contributions of our work are the following: (i) we present an analysis of the existing surveys in the literature, motivating the need of our work, since we present some aspects that had not been dealt with before, and we cover the latest works that are presented in the literature, (ii) we analyze the current worldwide market situation of EVs and their prospects, (iii) we make a thorough review of the battery technologies—from the lead-acid batteries to the Lithium-ion, including the latest technologies, such as graphene, (iv) we review the different standards available for EV charge, as well as the types of connectors that are defined by them, (v) we present the most relevant works related to Battery Management Systems (BMSs), thermal management, and power electronics, and (vi) we conclude our work by discussing what is shortly expected in this field, as well as the research aspects, which, in our opinion, are still open for both industry and academic community. The remainder of the paper is structured, as follows: Section 2 presents the most relevant surveys available in the literature, and motivates the need of our work. Section 3 presents an overview of the market, highlighting a taxonomy of the different types of EVs, the evolution of sales of EVs, and the current market situation. In Section 4 , we discuss the most remarkable features of the batteries, and the different types of batteries according to their technology. Section 5 shows the diverse existing standards for charging the EVs, the different charging modes of each standard, as well as the types of connectors defined by them. Section 6 explores the energy management in EVs, we especially focus on Battery Management Systems (BMSs), thermal management, and power electronics. In Section 7 , we discuss aspects that are related to the EVs, which, in our opinion, should be explored, that still require to be improved, or that present challenging opportunities to the scientific community. Last, but not least, Section 8 presents the main conclusions that were obtained from the realization of the present work. 2. Existing EV-Related Surveys In the last decade, there has been a significant progress in several aspects that are related to the production of electric vehicles, and the use of new technologies as well as their sales. Similarly, the research efforts have also increased, which has caused a significant increase of new jobs and proposals that are related to electric vehicles. Within this section, a short compilation of the most relevant topics related to EVs, which have been addressed by previously available works in the literature, are introduced. In addition, the more notable differences with this survey are highlighted. Some of the studies published to date deal with general aspects, such as the evolution of electrical vehicles throughout history, give diverse classifications according to the manner in which they have been designed and the characteristics of their engines, or analyze their impact on the electrical infrastructure. For instance, Yong et al. [ 9 ] review the history of EVs from their creation, in the middle of the nineteenth century, until present. Additionally, they carry out a classification of the vehicles according to their powertrain settings. Finally, their work analyzes the impact of charging electric vehicles on the electric grid. Likewise, Richardson [ 10 ] studies the effects that EVs can produce in the required productivity, efficiency, and capacity of the electric grid. Furthermore, he reviews the economical and environmental impact of electric vehicles. Habib et al. [ 11 ] present a review of charging methods for electric vehicles and analyze their impact in the power distribution systems. Additionally, the authors carry out an analysis of coordinated and non-coordinated charging methods, delayed loading, and intelligent planning of charges. Finally, they study the economic benefits of the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology according to the charging methods. Another aspect also dealt with in diverse works has been the use of renewable energy sources (i.e., wind power, solar, and biomass) and their incorporation in the electric vehicles field. Liu et al. [ 12 ] present a general vision about electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. They specifically focus on solar and wind power, and present a set of works that are classified into three categories: (i) those works which study the interaction between EVs and the renewable energy sources for reducing the energy cost, (ii) those works focused on improving the energy efficiency, and (iii) the proposals that are mainly seeking to reduce emissions. On the other hand, Hawkins et al. [ 13 ] analyze the existing studies about the environmental impact of the Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). For that purpose, they present a study of 51 environmental evaluations during the life span of the two kinds of vehicles (i.e., BEVs and HEVs). In their work, the authors take aspects, such as greenhouse gas emissions, the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity, as well as the production of vehicles, batteries, and their life span, into account. Vasant et al. [ 14 ] analyze the daily usage of PHEVs, and state that the appropriate deployment of daytime charging stations along with suitable charging control and management of this infrastructure can lead to a wider deployment of PHEVs. Unlike the previous works, Shuai et al. [ 15 ] provide a general vision of the new economic model that is present in electric vehicles, bearing in mind the unidirectional and bidirectional flows of energy (in which the EVs themselves are capable of providing energy to the electric grid). To do this, they analyze different charging facilities for EVs, as well as different methods for unidirectional charging and bidirectional energy commercialization. Finally, they study the use of these vehicles as a feasible storage for the energy that is generated from renewable sources. Other authors have focused on the different strategies that have been proposed for charging EVs. Tan et al. [ 16 ] revise the benefits and challenges of vehicle technology to the grid (V2G), in both the unidirectional and bidirectional charging. Besides advantages, they analyze the challenges, such as the battery deterioration and the high investment cost. Lastly, they complete a compilation of strategies for optimizing V2G, by grouping them according to the technique employed (e.g., genetic algorithms (GAs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)), as well as according to the objectives: (i) operation costs, (ii) carbon dioxide emissions, (iii) profit, (iv) support for renewable energy generation, (v) load curve, and (vi) power loss. Similar to the previous work, Hu et al. [ 17 ] present a revision and classification of methods for the intelligent charging of electric vehicles, but, in this case, focused on the fleet operators. In particular, they present works regarding battery modeling, charging and communications standards, as well as driving patterns. Lastly, they showcase a set of different control strategies to manage EV fleets, as well as mathematical algorithms for its modeling. Rahman et al. [ 18 ], present a set of employed methods for solving different problems that are related with the charging infrastructure of PHEVs and BEVs. Additionally, they assess the different charging systems in different environments, such as domestic garages, apartment complexes, and shopping centers. Because the massive EV deployment will introduce negative impacts on the existing power grid, some works review the different issues and the potential opportunities that EV integration in the smart grid can bring. Yong et al. [ 9 ] study the impact of EV deployment from the perspective of vehicle-to-grid technology, and especially for mitigating the renewable energies intermittency. Mahmud et al. [ 19 ] discuss all of the aspects related to EV charging, energy transfer, and grid integration with distributed energy resources in the Internet of Energy (IoE). More recently, Das et al. [ 20 ] present an evaluation on how future connected EVs and autonomous driving would affect EV charging and grid integration. Other important EV charging issues are those that are related to battery management, as well as battery health and lifetime estimations, since they are key factors in increasing the battery lifetime. Li et al. [ 21 ] review recent advancements in Big Data analytics to allow for data-driven battery health estimation. More specifically, they classify them in terms of feasibility and cost-effectiveness, and discuss their advantages and limitations. Liu et al. [ 22 ] go one step further and propose a machine learning-enabled system that is based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict lithium-ion batteries aging. Finally, other approaches instead explore advanced fault diagnosis techniques, since battery faults can potentially cause performance degradation [ 23 ]. As previously shown, in general, most of the studies that deal with EVs have focused on: (i) the impact of EV charging in the electric demand, (ii) the use of renewable energy sources in the charging process, and (iii) the proposal of new methods for optimizing the charge of electric vehicles, including grid solutions. However, in this paper, we present the current situation of the market of electric vehicles, the main characteristics of the batteries, their technologies, and charging processes. In particular, besides carrying out a comparison between the different standards, we display the different charging methods that are defined by these standards, and the connectors used by each of them. Finally, we also discuss the challenges that EVs have to face, and the research lines that we consider are left to explore yet. 3. Electric Vehicles In this section, we present a classification of the different types of electric vehicles, commenting on their main characteristics. We also discuss the current market situation, analyzing the sales data of this kind of vehicles and sales forecast in different countries in the world. 3.1. Electric VEHICLES Taxonomy Nowadays, we can encounter different types of EVs, according to their engines technology. In general, they are sorted in five types (See Figure 3 ): Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): vehicles 100% are propelled by electric power. BEVs do not have an internal combustion engine and they do not use any kind of liquid fuel. BEVs normally use large packs of batteries in order to give the vehicle an acceptable autonomy. A typical BEV will reach from 160 to 250 km, although some of them can travel as far as 500 km with just one charge. An example of this type of vehicle is the Nissan Leaf [ 24 ], which is 100% electric and it currently provides a 62 kWh battery that allows users to have an autonomy of 360 km. Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): hybrid vehicles are propelled by a conventional combustible engine and an electric engine charged by a pluggable external electric source. PHEVs can store enough electricity from the grid to significantly reduce their fuel consumption in regular driving conditions. The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV [ 25 ] provides a 12 kWh battery, which allows it to drive around 50 km just with the electric engine. However, it is also noteworthy that PHEVs fuel consumption is higher than indicated by car manufacturers [ 26 ]. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs): hybrid vehicles are propelled by a combination of a conventional internal combustion engine and an electric engine. The difference with regard to PHEVs is that HEVs cannot be plugged to the grid. In fact, the battery that provides energy to the electric engine is charged thanks to the power generated by the vehicle’s combustion engine. In modern models, the batteries can also be charged thanks to the energy generated during braking, turning the kinetic energy into electric energy. The Toyota Prius, in its hybrid model (4th generation), provided a 1.3 kWh battery that theoretically allowed it an autonomy as far as 25 km in its all-electric mode [ 27 ]. Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs): these vehicles are provided with an electric engine that uses a mix of compressed hydrogen and oxygen obtained from the air, having water as the only waste resulting from this process. Although these kinds of vehicles are considered to present “zero emissions”, it is worth highlighting that, although there is green hydrogen, most of the used hydrogen is extracted from natural gas. The Hyundai Nexo FCEV [ 28 ] is an example of this type of vehicles, being able to travel 650 km without refueling. Extended-range EVs (ER-EVs): these vehicles are very similar to those ones in the BEV category. However, the ER-EVs are also provided with a supplementary combustion engine, which charges the batteries of the vehicle if needed. This type of engine, unlike those provided by PHEVs and HEVs, is only used for charging, so that it is not connected to the wheels of the vehicle. An example of this type of vehicles is the BMW i3 [ 29 ], which has a 42.2 kWh battery that results in a 260 km autonomy in electric mode, and users can benefit an additional 130 km from the extended-range mode. 3.2. Subsidies and Market Position Despite the fact that the purchase price of electric vehicles is higher, when considering the internal combustion engine edition of the same vehicle model, the EV sales volume has experienced a significant growth, especially in the last years [ 30 ]. Additionally, many countries are preparing the mobility transition, discouraging the use of fossil fuel based cars, and stimulating electric mobility. Evidence of this is the fact that, after the Paris Agreement [ 31 ], there has been an increase of the public aids to this kind of vehicles. In fact, practically all of the governments of the developed countries are continuously applying new support and fostering policies for the use of electric vehicles in order to promote sustainable and environment-friendly mobility. Based on the report from [ 32 , 33 , 34 ], for instance, Belgium offers 4000 € of purchase aid, and these types of vehicles pay a road tax of only 74 €, instead of the 1900 € that traditional vehicles pay. In France, the users who purchase an EV receive a bonus of between 4000 € and 6000 € in the case of BEVs, and of 3500 € in the case of purchasing an PHEV. A discount between 50% and 100% is also offered in the registration fee. In the United Kingdom, an incentive of a maximum of £4500 will be offered with the purchase of an EV and, if its worth is less than £40,000, the vehicle is exempted of circulation taxes. In Germany, buyers receive a bonus of 4000 € to purchase a BEV, and of 3000 € in the case of PHEVs. Additionally, BEVs do not pay property taxes, while PHEVs have a reduction of 50%. In the case of Spain, an aid of between 1300 € and 5500 € is offered to purchase BEVs and HEVs, according to their autonomy. In Norway, the property tax for BEVs and PHEVs is of 47 €, while, for petrol-driven cars, such tax varies from 290 € to 340 €. In addition, BEVs do not pay circulation fees or tolls, and they do not pay for parking in the preferred parking areas. Finally, in the USA, the federal government provides $ 2500 for purchasing electric vehicles and an additional $ 417 for every kWh of their batteries from 4 kWh, to a maximum of $ 7500. All of these subsidies and policies (e.g., car purchasing tax exemption, VAT exemption, reduced license tax, tolls exemption, and free parking) are causing a noteworthy increase of the number of sales every year (especially in the last two years), as can be appreciated in Figure 4 and Table 1 . As we can observe, China and USA are, by far, the countries that have the most EV sales, although Norway stands out as the country in the world, in which EVs have a higher market share as almost three out of four vehicles sold in 2020 are electric. According to [ 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ], these numbers are expected to keep increasing within the next years, since several countries have expressed their desire to ban internal combustion engine vehicles in the near future. An example of this is Norway, which has announced that all the cars and vans sold in 2025 should be zero-emissions. For their part, India, Israel, and The Netherlands have announced that all of the vehicles sold in 2030 will be electric. Germany and United Kingdom delay this date to 2040, the same year in which combustion vehicles will also be banned in the state of California. In a more restrictive way, in Germany they are considering banning the circulation of diesel vehicles in the cities, and Paris has announced that they will forbid diesel vehicles to circulate in the city from 2024 and those of internal combustion from 2030. Rome will ban the circulation of diesel vehicles from 2024, whereas Madrid, Athens, and Mexico city will do it from 2025. However, besides the positive data of sales registered worldwide, it is also noteworthy that 95% of the electric vehicles were sold in only 10 countries (i.e., China, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway, United Kingdom, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden). Finally, it should also be emphasized that there are currently several models of BEVs and PHEVs for sale. Regarding the most sold models, the Tesla Model 3 (BEV), Toyota Prius Prime (PHEV), Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf (BEV), Tesla model S (BEV), Ford Fusion Energi (PHEV), and BMW i3 (BEV) stand out [ 30 , 49 ]. 4. Batteries In this section, interesting facts that are related to batteries are presented, such as the worldwide production increase, cost reduction, main characteristics, as well as the different existent technologies in the manufacturing process. In the last years, there have been great advancements in the development of batteries. In addition, the worldwide production of batteries for EVs has increased 66% [ 50 ], which is undoubtedly directly related to the rise of number of sales of the vehicles, with the forecast predicting the demand of batteries keeps growing. In fact, it is predicted that the offer and the demand of EVs will be even bigger in the coming years. 4.1. Characteristics of the Batteries Concerning the main characteristics of batteries, we can highlight the following: Capacity. The storage difficulty and cost is one of the main problems of electric power. Currently, this results in the allocation of great amounts of money in the development of new batteries with higher efficiency and reliability, thus improving batteries’ storage capacity. The battery capacity represents the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery under certain specified conditions. This unit can be expressed in ampere hour (Ah) or in watt hour (Wh), although the latter one is more commonly used by electric vehicles. When considering that, in EVs, the capacity of their batteries is a critical aspect, since it has a direct impact in the vehicles’ autonomy, the emergence of new technologies that enables the storage of a greater energy quantity in the shortest possible time will be a decisive factor in the success of this kind of vehicles. Table 2 shows data that are related to the battery capacities of EVs. As shown, the capacity of batteries is continuously growing and vehicles with more that 100 kWh batteries are expected very soon. Charge state. Refers to the battery level with regard to its 100% capacity. Energy Density. Obtaining the highest energy density possible is another important aspect in the development of batteries, in other words, that with equal size and weight a battery is able to accumulate a higher energy quantity. The energy density of batteries is measured as the energy that a battery is able to supply per unit volume (Wh/L). Specific energy. The energy that a battery is able to provide per unit mass (Wh/kg). Some authors also refer to this feature as energy density, and it can be specified in Wh/L or Wh/kg. Specific power. The power that a battery can supply per unit of weight (W/kg). Charge cycles. A load cycle is completed when the battery has been used or loaded 100%. Lifespan. Another aspect to consider is the batteries lifespan, which is measured in the number of charging cycles that a battery can hold. The goal is to obtain batteries that can endure a greater number of loading and unloading cycles. Internal resistance. The components of the batteries are not 100% perfect conductors, which means that they offer a certain resistance to the transmission of electricity. During the charging process, some energy is dispelled in the form of heat (namely, thermal loss). The generated heat per unit of time is equal to the lost power in the resistance, so the internal resistance will have a greater impact in high power charges [ 51 ]. Thus, more energy will be lost during quick charging processes when compared to slow ones. Therefore, it is highly important that batteries can support quick charging and higher temperatures induced due to the internal resistance. In addition, the decrease of this resistance can reduce the charging time that is required, which is one of the most important drawbacks of this type of vehicles today. Efficacy. It is the percentage of power that is offered by the battery in relation to the energy charged. 4.2. The Cornerstones: Cost, Capacity, and Charging Time Currently, the batteries are the main obstacle to EV wider adoption. The development of better, cheaper, and higher capacity batteries will extend vehicles autonomy, and the users view them as a true alternative to the internal combustion engine vehicles. In fact, batteries are a key component in EVs and therefore, there are increasing manufacturers (e.g., LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, and Bosch) that invest to develop improved and cheaper batteries. The most expensive component, in any EV, is the battery pack [ 52 ]. For instance, lithium-ion batteries of the Nissan LEAF initially represented a third of the cost of the whole vehicle. However, it is expected that this cost will be progressively reduced; at the end of 2013, the battery pack costs around $ 500 per kWh (up to half the price per kWh it cost in 2009); currently, the price per kWh is of $ 200, and it is expected to fall around $ 100 in 2025. Another fact that reinforces the battery cost reduction trend is that Tesla Motors is building a “Gigafactory” in order to cut down on the production costs and raise the manufacturing of batteries. The Gigafactory is designed to produce more lithium-ion batteries annually than the produced worldwide in 2013 [ 53 ]. The lower battery cost would have an obviously direct impact on EV price drop, which makes them more competitive with regard to traditional vehicles. Regarding the capacity, Figure 5 shows the capacity of the batteries of different EVs from 1983, the date on which the Audi Duo was marketed with an 8 kWh battery until 2022, the date on which Tesla announced that will market a Tesla Roadster with a 200 kWh battery [ 54 ]. When traveling with an EV, the key factor is the autonomy, but another limiting factor is the time that is required for charging the batteries. The standard power outlets provide around 3 kW power, which would imply a 10 h load on average for charging a maximum of 30 kWh energy in a battery [ 55 ]. Even in the case of using fast charging systems, charging a vehicle may require between 1 and 3 h. In order to solve this problem, an alternative is the creation of Battery Exchange Stations (BESs), which are also known as Battery Swap Stations (BSSs), where batteries are exchanged by similar ones already charged. Israel initially located 33 BESs [ 56 ], although Better Place (the company that developed battery-switching services for EVs) filed for bankruptcy in May 2013. However, this approach was extended to the city of Nanjing in 2015 [ 57 ], a city of eight million people, which has thousands of electric buses operating. BESs were also tested by taxi vehicles in Tokyo in 2010 [ 58 ]. Thinking about this strategy, Tesla created a system in their Model S, in which batteries can be exchanged in only 90 s [ 59 ]. Denmark is studying the possibility of creating a sufficient number of BESs with the purpose of providing an infrastructure with 900 charging points and charging batteries stations that are operated by robots [ 60 ]. Concerning the approaches that are related to battery exchange proposed on a scientific level, Adler and Mirchandani [ 61 ] suggested an in-line routing method for electric vehicles that allows for changing the batteries in BEs using Markov’s random decision processes. Such a method would reduce the waiting time more than 35%. Mak et al. [ 62 ] proposed robust optimization models that help the process of the battery exchange planning. The authors also analyzed the possibility of battery standardization and technological development in the optimal strategy for deploying the infrastructures. Yang et al. [ 63 ] presented a dynamic operation model of BSSs in the electric market, acquiring extra incomes when actively responding to the price fluctuation in the electricity market. Storandt and Funke [ 64 ] approached the EVs routing problem with the aim of finding out what destinations are accessible from a particular location according to the current battery level of the vehicle and the availability of charging or exchange battery stations. 4.3. Different Components and Battery Types However, the increase of the number of EV models, as well as the different types of batteries and the lack of standardization, are not making the use of BESs a feasible process, since all of the vehicles served by BES should use identical batteries [ 65 ]. In fact, although lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are increasingly used in EVs, there exists a great variety of batteries, among which the following stand out: Lead-acid batteries (Pb-PbO 2 ). These batteries were invented in 1859 and are the oldest kind of rechargeable battery. Although this kind of battery is very common in conventional vehicles, it has also been used in electric vehicles. It has very low specific energy and energy density ratios. The battery is formed by a sulfuric acid deposit and a group of lead plates. During the initial loading process, the lead sulfate is reduced to metal in the negative plates, while, in the positives, lead oxide is formed (PbO 2 ). The GM EV1 and the Toyota RAV4 EV, are examples of vehicles that used this kind of batteries. Nickel-cadmium batteries (Ni-Cd). This technology was used in the 90s, as these batteries have a greater energy density [ 66 ], but they present high memory effect, low lifespan, and cadmium is a very expensive and polluting element. For these reasons, nickel-cadmium batteries are currently being substituted by nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries. Nickel-metal-hydride batteries (Ni-MH). In this type of batteries, an alloy that stores hydrogen is used for negative electrodes instead of cadmium (Cd) [ 67 ]. Although they present a higher level of self discharge than those of nickel-cadmium, these batteries are used by many hybrid vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius and the second version of the GM EV1. The Toyota RAV4 EV, apart from having a lead-acid version, also had another with nickel-metal-hydride. Zinc-bromine batteries (Zn-Br 2 ). These kinds of batteries use a zinc-bromine solution stored in two tanks, and in which bromide turns into bromine in the positive electrode. This technology was used by a prototype, called ”T-Star”, in 1993 [ 68 ]. Sodium chloride and nickel batteries (NA-NiCl). Also being referred to as Zebra, they are very similar to sodium sulfur batteries. Their advantage is that they can offer up to 30% more energy in low temperatures, although its optimum operating range is between 260 °C and 300 °C. These kinds of batteries are ideal for its use in electric vehicles [ 69 ]. The disappeared Modec company used them in 2006. Sodium sulfur batteries (Na-S), which contain sodium liquid (Na) and sulfur (S). This type of battery has a high energy density, high loading and unloading efficiency (89–92%), and a long life cycle. In addition, their advantage is that these materials have a very low cost. However, they can reach functioning temperatures of between 300 and 350 °C [ 70 ]. This type of batteries is used in the Ford Ecostar, the model that was launched in 1992–1993. Lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ion). These batteries employ, as electrolyte, a lithium salt that provides the necessary ions for the reversible electrochemical reaction that takes place between the cathode and anode. Lithium-ion batteries have the advantages of the lightness of their components, their high loading capacity, their internal resistance, as well as their high loading and unloading cycles. In addition, they present a reduced memory effect. Lithium-ion batteries must operate within a safe and reliable operation area, which is restricted by the temperature and voltage windows. Exceeding the restrictions of these windows will cause a quick mitigation of the battery performance and even result in a security hazard (e.g., catch fire or even explode), as from 150 °C electrolytes start to destroy themselves [ 71 ]. This type of battery is the most used today by the majority of EVs and PHEVs. Table 3 and Figure 6 include a comparison of the most relevant characteristics of the different technologies introduced. An important aspect when comparing the different technologies is their working temperature, since it can limit their adoption. In that regard, lead-acid and lithium batteries are the best that put up with low temperatures, as they can load temperatures up to −20 °C, although, in the case of Li-Ion batteries, low temperatures seriously affect its capacity, causing self-discharge [ 72 ]. In fact, this type of battery has an optimum functioning temperature of 40 °C. As we can also observe, batteries that are formed by sodium (Na-NiCl y Na-S) have higher functioning temperatures. Regarding the specific energy and the energy density, lead-acid (Pb-PbO 2 ) and Nickel (Ni-Cd, Ni-MH) batteries stand out negatively, while the more valuable batteries are, by far, the lithium-ion ones. Concerning the specific power, lead and zinc batteries offer worse results (up to 100 W/kg), while the kinds of batteries with the best scores are those of Ni-MH (with a maximum of 1000 W/kg), and Li-ion, which offer up to 3000 W/kg. As far as the cells voltage, batteries that are formed by nickel and zinc are the ones with lower voltage, while sodium batteries (Na-S y Na-NiCl) and Li-ion use a higher voltage. On the other hand, with respect to the life cycles, the batteries that offer worse results are those of Ni-MH and lead-acid. Lastly, lithium batteries are able to support up to 3000 cycles, and those of Na-S are those that offer better results, supporting up to 4500 cycles. When considering all of the above parameters, current electric vehicles rely on lithium ion technology for their batteries, as this technology presents the best performance in almost all of the analyzed characteristics. 5. Charging of Electric Vehicles Besides the autonomy, another important aspect is the duration and the characteristics of the charging process of the batteries. In order for the EVs to definitely succeed, it will be necessary that the users can charge their vehicles in a fast and simple way. To do so, it will be fundamental to have an infrastructure deployment that allows such fast and simple charge. This implies charging at homes, and the creation of electric charging stations that provide quick charges during long commuting. Below, the different standards or rules that are created for electric vehicles charging technology are presented. In particular, we detail the different charging modes that are defined in the current standards, as well as the connectors. When charging electric vehicles, we can find different standards, which are determined, mainly, by the region in which they are being used or applied. More specifically, in North America, and in the Pacific zone, the SAE-J1772 standard for loading electric vehicles is used. However, in China, the GB/T 20234 standard is used, whereas, in Europe, the IEC-62196 standard was introduced. The main difference between these three standards is that while the two former ones classify the charging modes according to the power type (DC or AC power), the latter one classifies such modes by the charging power involved. The SAE-J1772 [ 73 ] mode is a North American standard of electric connectors for electric vehicles created in 1996, and supported by SAE International. This standard is common in USA and Japan, and it establishes the following charging modes (see Table 4 ): AC Level 1. Standard electrical outlet that provides voltage in AC of 120 V offering a maximum intensity of 16 A, which serves a maximum power of 1.9 kW. AC Level 2. Standard electrical outlet with 240 V AC and a maximum intensity of 80 A, so it offers a maximum power of 19.2 kW. DC Level 1. External charger that by inserting a maximum voltage of 500 V DC with a maximum intensity of 80 A, it provides a maximum power of 40 kW. DC Level 2. External charger that, by inserting a maximum voltage of 500 V DC with a maximum intensity of 200 A, provides a maximum power of 100 kW. 5.1. Charging Modes The IEC-62196 standard [ 74 ] is an international standard created by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2001 for charging electrical vehicles in Europe and China. The IEC-62196 establishes the general characteristics of the charging process, as well as the way in which the energy is supplied. This norm derives from the IEC-61851 and it provides a first classification of the charging type according to its nominal power and, thus, of the charging time [ 74 , 75 ]. Users are provided with four modes in order to charge the vehicles (see Table 5 ). Mode 1 (Slow charging). It is defined as a domestic charging mode, with a maximum intensity of 16 A, and it uses a standard single-phase or three-phase power outlet with phase(s), neutral, and protective earth conductors. This mode is the most used in our homes. Mode 2 (Semi-fast charging). This mode can be used at home or in public areas, its defined maximum intensity is of 32 A, and, similar to the previous mode, it uses standardized power outlets with phase(s), neutral, and protective earth conductors. Mode 3 (Fast charging). It provides an intensity between 32 and 250 A. This charging mode requires the use of an EV Supply Equipment (EVSE), a specific power supply for charging electric vehicles. This device (i.e., the EVSE) provides communication with the vehicles, monitors the charging process, incorporates protection systems, and stops the energy flow when the connection to the vehicle is not detected. Mode 4 (Ultra-fast charging). Published in the IEC-62196-3, it defines a direct connection of the EV to the DC supply network with a power intensity of up to 400 A and a maximum voltage of 1000 V, which provides a maximum charging power up to 400 kW. These modes also require an external charger that provides communication between the vehicle and the charging point, as well as protection and control. Guobiao Standards (GB) created the GB/T-20234 standard for charging infrastructures of electric vehicles in China. Although China initially adopted the European standard IEC-62196, the use of their own standard, such as the GB/T-20234, is being promoted. This standard classifies the charging modes between AC and DC, as shown in Table 6 . Based on the survey performed, the SAE-J1772 standard is the only one that includes a 120 V charging mode (see Table 4 ). The rest of standards, even in their lowest charging modes, work at a higher voltages. As for their most powerful modes, the SAE-J1772 is also the standard that offers a lower voltage (i.e., 500 V) when compared to the 1000 V offered by both the IEC-62196 and the GB/T-20234. Regarding the amperage, the standard that offers a lower current intensity is the GB/T-20234 with 10 A against the 16 A offered by the other two standards. However, in their most powerful modes, the SAE-J1772 only supports a 200 A maximum intensity, as compared to 250 A of the GB/T-20234 and 400 A of the IEC-62196. Concerning the charging modes that are based on AC power, the standard that offers a lower power load is the SAE-J1772 with 1.9 kWh when compared to the 2.5 kWh of the GB/T-20234 and the 3.8 kWh supported by the IEC-62196. The standard that offers higher power is the IEC-62196 with 120 kWh, against the 27.7 kWh of the GB/T-20234 and the 19.2 kWh of the SAE-J1772. Something similar occurs in the loading modes based on DC power, in which the IEC-62196 is the standard that offers higher power with 400 kWh, against the 250 kWh of the GB/T-20234 and the 100 kWh offered by the SAE-J1772. It is also worth noting the case of Tesla Company, which, although it is not an international standard itself, it has its own fast charging points, called Supercharger Stations. Tesla’s superchargers work in DC and use their own system, whose patents have been mostly released. Although they have a maximum charging power of 145 kWh, such power is currently limited to 120 kWh, which allows for charging half of the battery of a Model S in only 20 min., or 80% in half an hour [ 7 ]. Although Tesla affirms that its superchargers are ultra-fast charging points, if we consider the IEC-62196 criterion (see Table 5 ), these charging points would be equal to a Mode 3 (fast charging). Tesla’s Supercharger Stations are being installed in main routes every 200 km. Currently, there are 1604 stations and a total of 14,081 superchargers around the world [ 7 ]. Additionally, the users of these vehicles have 400 kWh of free charging, which is enough for driving about 1600 km, a strategy that seeks to encourage users to purchase Tesla vehicles. 5.2. Connectors Electric vehicles have an AC/DC converter that allows charging their batteries at home through the use of traditional outlets (e.g., the Schuko in Europe). However, when requiring faster charges, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations must be used, since they can directly supply DC power to the batteries. Charging Stations can supply electricity through different connectors, depending on the standard supported, and they present the following advantages: They are sealed solutions (not affected by water or humidity). They carry a mechanic or electronic blockage. They enable communication with the vehicle. Electricity is not supplied until the blockage system is not activated. While the blockage system is activated, the vehicle cannot be set in motion, so that a vehicle cannot leave while plugged. Some connectors are able to charge in three-phase mode. There currently exists a wide range of connectors for charging electric vehicles. These connectors are defined by the different standards: the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is in charge of its normalization in the US and in part of the Pacific countries; the IEC is responsible for its standardization in a great part of the countries in the world, mainly in Europe; and, the Guobiao Standards (GB) manages the standardization in China. J1772-2009 connectors include different protection levels, and they can even be used in rainy conditions. The AC version (see Figure 7 a) was designed for single-phase electric systems with 120 V or 240 V, and they consist of five pins: AC pins, two pins to provide power to the vehicle (phase and neutral). Ground connection, a security measure, which connects the electrical system to the ground. Proximity detection, which avoids the vehicle to move while plugged. Pilot Control, which allows communication with the vehicle. There exists a second version of the connector that is designed to perform a fast charge. This allows the charging time to be drastically reduced, charging the batteries of a vehicle up to the 80% in 20 min. This connector, the so-called Combined Charging System (CCS), enables AC slow charge or fast charge to DC, and its appearance is very similar to the AC version, but with two additional pins to charge in DC (see Figure 7 b). The IEC-62196 adopted the specifications of the connectors of the IEC 60309 standard, including them in its second version (IEC-62196-2), which was published by the IEC in October of 2011. More specifically, it suggests four types of plugs: Type 1 (SAE-J1772-2009) Yazaki. With the aim of finding a standardized connector, the Type 1 AC charging, apart from being included in the SAE-J1772 standard, was also included in the IEC-62196-2. In fact, this connector is commonly found in charging equipments for EVs in North America and Japan [ 80 ], and it is used by a great amount of vehicles, such as the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt, the Toyota Prius Prime, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the Ford Focus Electric, the Tesla Roadster, and the Tesla Model S. This connector can be observed in Figure 7 a. Type 2 (VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2) Mennekes. It was originally designed to be used in the industrial sector, so it was not specifically designed for EVs (see Figure 7 c). In single-phase it is limited up to 230 V, but, in three-phase, is able to hold high voltages and intensities. This connector has 7 pins, i.e., four for the power (in three-phase mode), one ground connection, and two pins to communicate with the vehicle (blockage and communications). An example of a vehicle that uses this connector is the Renault Zoe, which can be charged with the Mennekes connector up to 43 kWh. Although, at first, it was not designed for fast charging, Type 2 also includes another connector, called Combined Charging System (CCS) (see Figure 7 d), being essentially an adapted Mennekes adapted to supply up to 400 A to 1000 V, which would imply a charging power up to 400 kWh [ 81 , 82 ]. Type 3 (EV Plug Alliance connector) Scame. Single-phase and three-phase connector, designed by the EV Plug Alliance in 2010. It supplies 230 V/400 V and from 16 to 63 A [ 83 ]. France and Italy suggested the use of this connector for their vehicles (see Figure 7 e), but, due to the poor acceptance, the production of Type 3 connectors has been finally abandoned. Type 4 (EVS G105-1993) CHAdeMO. Promoted by TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company), it is commonly found in the EVs charging equipment in Japan, although it is also used in Europe and USA (see Figure 7 f). CHAdeMO is designed to supply fast charges in DC. In its first versions, it held up to 400 V, starting the charge with up to 200 A. Nowadays, CHAdeMO chargers have already been designed with 150 kW power, and they aim to reach 350 kW [ 84 ]. This connector has ten pins, two for DC power supply, one for ground connection, and seven pins for communicating with the network. On the 8th of February of 2018, there existed 7133 CHAdeMO charging points in Japan, 6022 in Europe, and 2290 in the USA [ 85 ]. In fact, it is added to numerous vehicles, such as in the Nissan Leaf, the Nissan e-NV200, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and the KIA Soul EV. Concerning the GB/T 20234 standard that is used in China, a distinguishing feature against the SAE-J1772 and IEC-62196, is that, while the latter ones use the same communication protocol between the vehicle and the charger, the Chinese standard operates with a different one, which causes the incompatibility of these charging systems [ 86 ]. The GB/T 20234 considers two kinds of connectors. The connector used for charges based on AC is physically the same used in the IEC Type 2 or the Mennekes (see Figure 7 c), although they are incompatible with the European vehicles that use the same connector, as they use different protocols. The standard defines their own connector in order to carry out the DC charges (see Figure 7 g). Finally, Tesla employs two different connectors for the fast charging of their vehicles, when considering whether the vehicles are sold in Europe (see Figure 7 c) or in the United States (see Figure 7 h). In Europe, Tesla adopted the Mennekes connector, although slightly modified in order to perform both domestic charge (AC) and ultra-fast charges (DC) in their Superchargers. For the United States, Tesla designed their own connector. 6. Power Control and Energy Management The energy management is a critical factor for EVs and PHEVs. Hence, the battery management system (BMS) is a key system that is designed to manage and control the battery unit in this kind of vehicle. More specifically, BMS is responsible for managing the energy that is provided by the batteries with the aim of guaranteeing their safety and reliability. Current BMSs comprise of multiple blocks, such as power delivery unity, sensors, and communication channels, integrated together. The prime task of BMSs is to manage the power delivery trying to reduce the battery stress due to charges and discharges. BMS is the central controller preventing sudden abruption in current, and thus avoiding high discharge rates. Cell balancing is also critical for EVs’ high-powered battery packs, because a long series of individual cells is only as reliable as the weakest cell. According to this, the BMS maintains cell balancing by compensating the load of the weaker cell. In particular, it equalizes the charge on all cells in the chain to extend the overall life of the battery pack. In this way, BMS prevents individual cells from becoming overstressed. Another important task of BMSs is measuring the state of charge and computing the driving range. Auxiliary devices, such as headlamps, the dashboard, and the cooling/heating unit, also draw power from the battery pack. However, these devices are not smart, nor do they communicate with BMS. A smarter managing of these energy demands would result in a better power delivery without reducing the power train efficiency. Related to all of the abovementioned issues, several authors have proposed different BMS architectures. For instance, Hauser and Kuhn [ 87 ] present the requirements that a BMS should cover: (i) data acquisition, (ii) data processing and storage, (iii) electrical management, (iv) thermal management, (v) safety management, and (vi) communication. Taking all of these characteristics into account, they show a BMS schematic illustration (see Figure 8 ). Other authors, such as Xing et al. [ 88 ], present a review of BMS for Battery Electric (BEVs) and Hybrid Vehicles (HVs) when considering the state of charge, the state of health, and the state of life, as the key features to be considered by BMSs. A more ambitious feature to be included by future BMSs was proposed by Zhang et al. [ 89 ]. Particularly, the authors simulate how to extend driving ranges, by predicting both terrain changes and preceding vehicle’s movement. In their simulations, EV velocity and motor torque distribution are optimized by a nonlinear predictive controller model to reduce energy consumption. In fact, future BMSs will be smarter and faster, integrating on chip analytics capabilities to accurately estimate driving ranges and smart adapting to load changes for better power delivery. BMSs will also support: (i) different and adaptive charging protocols, (ii) any battery cell number, sizes, and configurations, and (iii) vehicle to grid capabilities, enabling charging transactions or booking charging slots. Thermal Management and Power Electronics One of the most important blocks in BMSs is thermal management, as can be observed in Figure 8 . In particular, it can be necessary to increase batteries’ temperature to improve their performance in cold weather conditions. With this aim, Shang et al. [ 90 ] proposed a high-frequency sine-wave (SW) heater that is based on resonant LC converters to self-heat the automotive batteries at low-temperatures. Their proposal is able to double the heating speed without the need of external heaters. In [ 91 ], they also proposed a compact heater, based upon resonant switched capacitors (RSCs) that are powered by the on-board battery pack, leading to an easy implementation, which is able to increase up to 2.67 °C/min. with a high efficiency (96.4%). However, high temperature is the most common problem for EV batteries and power electronics present in EVs. In this sense, power electronics become very important. The continuous power density increase of electric motors requires higher power to be delivered by electronics, which results in a higher heat dissipation. To address this issue, Nonneman et al. [ 92 ] presented a comparison between different cooling strategies under similar conditions. Unlike other existing works, the authors accounted for other criteria, such as cost, complexity, and practical feasibility to better design inverters for EVs. In the same line, other authors, such as Mouawad et al. [ 93 ], proposed cost effective and high integration, as well as performance power electronic systems. In particular, they present a Silicon Carbide Integrated Power Module that integrates multiple functional elements (i.e., semiconductor devices, DC-link capacitors, output filters, current sensing, and gate driver), which is able to increase power density, improve electrical performance, and reduce the costs without compromising thermal performance or reliability. 7. Challenges of the Research and Open Opportunities Although the development and evolution of the electric vehicles have undergone a great growth, especially in the last years, in this section we comment on the aspects that are still pending, or that can be interesting to explore to propose new and enhanced solutions. We have classified these opportunities into four fields: (i) the use of new batteries technologies or manufacturing processes, (ii) the improvement and optimization of the charging process, (iii) the use of communications and Artificial Intelligence in electric vehicles for improving the mobility and for an efficient use of the charging infrastructure, and, finally, (iv) eco charge (i.e., using green energy) and sustainability issues that are related to EVs. 7.1. New Challenges and Technologies in Batteries for EVs Batteries are one the most important components of EVs, since they are one of the most costly components of the overall cost of the vehicle, and batteries directly affect the EV performance, as we have previously discussed in the Section 4 . The improvement in terms of durability, in charging densities, and in the charge and discharge processes, have caused the use of multiple resources in the development of new technologies that are able to surpass the current lithium-ion batteries, which are the ones massively used in vehicles. In our view, there is still work to do in this field, fundamentally due to its impact, as the improvement of batteries can accelerate EVs success and the worldwide deployment of these vehicles in a remarkable way. At present, new technologies and components are being researched. Some of them are the following: Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4 ). This kind of battery presents an energy density of approximately 220 Wh/L, a great durability (they are able to withstand between 2000 and 10,000 cycles) and tolerate high temperatures. However, although this type of battery is starting to be tested in EVs [ 94 ], it still can be found in an early stage of research and development. MIT researchers have managed to reduce its weight and they have developed a prototype-cell that can be completely charged in just 10–20 s, a reduced time if we compare it with the necessary 6 min. for standard battery cells [ 95 ]. Magnesium-ion (Mg-Ion). These batteries change the use of lithium over magnesium, succeeding in storing more than double the charge and increasing its stability. It is expected that this type of battery can have a 6.2 kWh/L energy density [ 96 ], which would imply 8.5 times more than the best lithium batteries, which are currently able to apply up to 0.735 kWh/L. Organizations, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), Toyota, or NASA, are investigating this type of battery [ 97 , 98 ]. Lithium-metal. In these batteries, graphite-anode is replaced by a fine lithium-metal layer. This kind of battery is able to store double of the power than a traditional lithium battery [ 99 ]. SolidEnergy Systems, a MIT startup, have already started to deploy this type of batteries in drones, and it is expected that they can be included in EVs [ 100 ]. Lithium-metal batteries have a high Coulombic efficiency (above 99.1%), withstanding more than 6000 charging cycles, and, after 1000 cycles they maintain an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.4% [ 101 ]. Lithium-air (Li-air). This kind of battery needs a constant supply of oxygen to conduct the reaction with the lithium. They were initially proposed in the 70s, although it was not until recently that have started to be developed and improved. It is expected that its specific energy reaches around 12 kWh/kg (almost 45 times the current of lithium), which would imply being at the same level as the fuel [ 102 ]. Aluminum-air. Batteries that are developed with this technology produce electricity from the reaction of oxygen with aluminum. Their main advantage is that this type of battery reaches very large energy densities, attaining 6.2 kWh/L [ 103 ], which allows obtaining a high autonomies (up to 1600 km) [ 104 ]. The price of this kind of battery is decreasing, currently positioning in 300 €/kWh [ 105 ], and their advantage is that they are recyclable. Sodium-air (Na 2 O 2 ). The company BASF created a Sodium-air battery with an energy density of 4.5 kWh/L [ 106 ]. In electric vehicles, this type of battery can multiply the autonomy of the current lithium batteries at least thirteen times [ 107 ]. A great advantage of this type of batteries is that sodium is the sixth more abundant element in our planet [ 108 ]. Graphene. Graphene is a material that is formed by pure carbon, which has a high thermal conductivity and it is extremely light (a one square meter blade weighs 0.77 mg) [ 109 ]. One of the major assets of graphene-based batteries is that they barely heat, enabling fast or ultra-fast charges without significant power losses due to heat. Graphenano, a Spanish company, has created a graphene battery that, added to a GTA Spano vehicle (900 hp), has been able to travel 800 km [ 110 ]. In a high power plug, this battery could be charged in only 5 min. This kind of battery is in an early phase of development, although there exist prototypes of graphene batteries with a specific power of 1 kWh/kg, and it is expected to reach 6.4 kWh/kg soon [ 111 ]. We consider that the technology is able to increase the autonomy of EVs and considerably reduce the time that is required for a complete charge will be the one that will finally succeed in the market. 7.2. Improvements in the Charging Process In this section, we focus on the charging process, a key aspect regarding battery vehicles, and it also crucial in the field of electric vehicles, as it is highly important to facilitate users charging process, enabling EVs to reach longer distances. One of the most important issues when charging an electric vehicle is the connector. The American and Japanese markets bet on the connectors that were proposed by the J1772 standard, while the European vehicles use the ones that were suggested by the IEC-62196. Although these markets are quite different and separate, this fact is not desirable and it can cause difficulties for users when charging their vehicles; purchasing adapters can be required, thereby increasing the cost of Electric Vehicles, and sometimes introducing safety risks. This problem also occurs in fast charging points. As we have previously discussed in Section 5.2 , there currently exist three types of standard connectors to conduct fast charges: (i) the CCS included in the J1772, (ii) the CHAdeMO added in the IEC-62196, and (iii) the GB/T. In addition, we should also consider the one used by Tesla in its superchargers. Although Tesla, for instance, has bet on the fact that some of its vehicles have more than one type of connector, we consider it more important to progress in the creation of a unified standard, which would allow for charging all of the vehicles through a universal connector when considering the differences in the energy systems of the different regions. We consider that this universal connector will help EV drivers, but, especially, it will have a significant environmental impact. Another aspect that can revolutionize the charging process is applying intelligent algorithms to optimize the charges, either reducing the cost, or improving the use of the electrical infrastructure. Currently, the charging process usually starts just in the moment in which the vehicle is connected to the charging point (as it is typically known as Plug&Charge); however, the price of electricity varies throughout the day in most countries, so the charging start could be adapted to significantly reduce the charging cost by avoiding the periods of high demand (where the economic cost is higher). The implementation of intelligent plugs could help EVs to gain more market share over the internal combustion engine vehicles. Although there are initial works and proposals in this area [ 112 , 113 , 114 ], we consider that there are still several open issues and potential works to be done in this field, as the use of communications between the vehicles and the electric infrastructure, as well as the new technologies based on Artificial Intelligence (e.g., Deep Learning techniques or Optimization Strategies [ 115 ]), will enable highly enhanced charging processes, as well as significantly reducing the economic cost. As for community or public parking lots, we consider that using adaptive charging techniques can also be very useful, since the available infrastructure can be limited to simultaneously power all charging points. According to this, smart load balancing systems that are able to intelligently and efficiently manage the charging points should be proposed. The reasoning behind this is to be able to satisfy the charging needs of crowded scenarios without investing in new power infrastructure. Finally, we must consider wireless charge, as an alternative to the conventional charging technologies, since it enables charging EVs batteries while driving. In fact, wireless power transfer (WPT) is very convenient because of its flexibility and comfort. Capacitive power transfer (CPT) and inductive power transfer (IPT) are the two wireless charge modes. However, it is important to note that IPT is the most commonly used, as it can be applied to many gap distances and power levels. By contrast, CPT, although it has been shown to be valid for kilowatt-power-level applications, it is only suitable for small gap power transfers. In addition, there exist three different types of wireless charges when considering their context: (i) stationary charging, when the vehicle is parked, (ii) opportunistic charging, when the vehicle is stopped for a short period of time, (e.g., in a traffic light), and (iii) dynamic charging, when the vehicle is moving along a dedicated charging lane [ 116 ]. Related to wireless charging, Manshadi et al. [ 117 ] present the advantages of wireless charging stations in terms of electricity costs and congestion in the electricity network. Dai et al. [ 118 ] provide a critical comparison of IPT and CPT for small gap applications, wherein the theoretical and empirical limitations of each approach are established. In particular, they compare the two approaches in terms of power level, gap distance, operational frequency, and efficiency. Focusing only on CPT, Li et al. [ 119 ] presented a family of compensation topologies to achieve constant-voltage or constant-current output in CPT-based charges. The successful and effective deployment of wireless electric vehicles charging requires the development of cost effective, high performance, and high integration power electronic systems. In that sense, Nohara et al. [ 120 ] propose a miniaturized wireless EV charger with a high power-factor drive and natural cooling structure that incorporates the simple quasi-resonant single-ended inverter. Their approach significantly reduces the weight and volume of the converter while solving the problem of power factor and cooling. Other authors aim to greatly extend the EV operating range by exploiting the wireless charge capabilities. For example, Wang et al. [ 121 ] propose a dynamic wireless charging system that is able to fully switch the vehicle’s driving power to wireless charging while the vehicle is driving on the charging area. More specifically, the proposed system can dynamically adjust the voltage value of the transmitting end or the equivalent load resistance value of the electric vehicle. Although this technology is very promising (for instance, the use of dynamic charging would increase the driving range, even reducing the size of the battery packs), current high associated costs, and the lack of a unique and universal standard make wireless charges an unfeasible alternative to traditional wired charging process in the short term. 7.3. Communications and AI in Electric Vehicles In order for electric vehicles to completely turn into the predominant mean of transport in our cities and roads, diverse factors will necessarily have to come together, as previously examined. Obviously, the development that is undergoing during the last years, in terms of autonomy, power, technology, and comfort, is helping buyers to consider EVs as an actual possibility when purchasing a new vehicle. Although the price is slightly higher (in some models, the difference with respect to the combustion engine version engine is notable), the purchasing aids and the reduced tax schemes are also helping to reduce the existing gap. However, there exist other aspects that are also essential, but they still need to be improved to lead the way to electric vehicles. The worldwide deployment of EV charging stations is the first of such aspects. Up to now, in the majority of countries, the number of charging points available is rather scarce, which certainly stops buyers. We consider that greater effort is needed to improve the charging infrastructure. Additionally, the time that is necessary to completely charge the batteries of these vehicles must be considerably reduced, so that users view electric vehicles as more attractive. Fortunately, we believe that the use of vehicular communications and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can catalyze the actual implementation of the new more ecological and sustainable transport. Wireless communication networks will allow vehicles to be provided with a communication system that enables communications capabilities among vehicles (V2V) and the infrastructure (V2I). In addition, the use of algorithms that are based on AI will provide certain intelligence to the vehicles, and it will open up to countless new opportunities that will revolutionize the future transport systems. We can find several proposals, based on Artificial Intelligence, related to different EV areas, such as energy efficient routing, better and smarter charges, or battery thermal management. Regarding to efficient routing, Masikos et al. [ 122 ] introduce a novel machine learning-based methodology for energy efficient routing. Their approach is able to predict the energy consumption for the different road segments that constitute the actual or potential vehicle routes. Alesiani and Maslekar [ 123 ] address the problem of finding the routes for a fleet of electric vehicles. Their proposal not only considers the battery limit of the vehicle, but also the concurrent use of charging stations along the route while using an evolutionary genetic algorithm with learning strategy. As for smarter charges, Sugii et al. [ 124 ] propose a genetic algorithm-based scheduling method for charging multiple EVs. In particular, this approach can determine the power curve and electric power load levering. Additionally, it can reduce the capacity of the charging equipment and its initial cost. Panahi et al. [ 125 ] propose the use of ANNs to forecast daily load profile of individual EVs and fleets, as user habits is one of the most important issues in EV charges. More specifically, they use historical data to predict electricity demand and better coordinate the charges. Related to battery thermal management, Park et al. [ 126 ] propose the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to improve the thermal management system and reduce the total energy consumption. The proposal allows for maintaining the battery temperature within an acceptable range. Karimi et al. [ 127 ] analyze the relationship between battery thermal behavior and design parameters. In particular, their numerical analysis show that a cooling strategy that is based on distributed forced convection can provide uniform temperature and voltage distributions within the battery pack at different discharge rates. The combined use of communications and AI will promote the appearance of new solutions that: (i) facilitate the charging process of batteries (by providing an early booking of the charging point, automatic power balancing capabilities, adaptive charges that are based on the context, etc.), (ii) improve the power generation process to satisfy the great electric demand on the grid that will arise (by offering predictions of necessary power in every moment, mobility analysis of the EVs, etc.), and (iii) speed up the transition process of assisted driving, to complete autonomous driving. Subsequently, we are very close to the advent of the Internet of EVs concept (IoEVs), which will certainly change dramatically the way in which we move, but it will also open us a new world of research possibilities, including new applications and services. 7.4. Eco Charge and Sustainability Electric vehicles have appeared as a model of sustainability and respect to the environment, due to the fact they do not emit harmful substances to the air, unlike conventional internal combustion vehicles. Such sustainability is not only limited to the usage of hybrid or electric vehicles, but also their design, the prime materials used in the manufacturing of these vehicles, and the energy footprint during its use, as well as the subsequent recycling of their components influencing the circles of sustainability. However, these ideas are changing due to the appearance of several studies that have questioned the sustainability and environmental impact of EVs [ 128 , 129 , 130 , 131 ]. In particular, three important stages should be taken into account: (i) their fabrication process, (ii) the usage throughout their lifetime, and (iii) their disposal and recycling process. Regarding the EV production, some studies consider that it can require more than twice as much energy to produce an electric car as compared to a conventional one [ 128 , 129 ], especially due to the batteries production. More specifically, the mining and processing minerals required to manufacture EV batteries (e.g., lithium, copper, cobalt, manganese, and rare earths like neodymium), as well as battery manufacturing with current technology, requires from 350 to 650 Megajoules per kWh [ 129 ]. In addition, each kWh of battery capacity involves from 150 to 200 kg of CO 2 emissions. This means, for example, that producing a 22 kWh BMW i3 battery emits almost 3 tons of CO 2 . As for the usage of EVs, one key point is the high amount of electricity that is required to charge these vehicles’ batteries, especially when they will be widely deployed [ 130 ]. Moreover, such power demand would indirectly harm the environment, depending on the electric power source generation. Although EVs do not emit climate-damaging greenhouse gases and NO 2 , the required electricity could be produced by fossil-fuel power plants, and thus limit the supposed climate benefits. For example, almost half of the electricity generated in Germany comes from coal and gas [ 132 ]. Hence, the use of renewable energies for manufacturing and charging electric vehicles is a key aspect. Especially for charges, this kind of power (mainly the solar and wind power) could be stored to be used in high demand periods or for cheapening the charging prices [ 133 , 134 , 135 , 136 , 137 ]. Concerning the infrastructure that is needed for EVs deployment, and trying to propose more eco-friendly approaches, Bhatti et al. [ 138 ] summarize all of the aspects related to EVs charging focusing on the use of solar photovoltaic modules. More specifically, they analyze the requirements of grid powered photovoltaic EV charging, including its economic and environmental impact. Similarly, Calise et al. [ 139 ] present a novel paradigm for sustainable mobility that is based on EVs, photovoltaic energy, and energy storage systems, including a comparison to the conventional grid-to-vehicle approach. Particularly, they demonstrate that, during the summer, solar energy can cover an important amount of the total energy demand. Regarding the EV disposal, once the batteries’ lifetime has ended, they can be an environmental hazard, and correct recycling is essential for the successful implementation of this transportation technology. Recycling provides a good opportunity to reduce the life cycle costs, enabling the recovery of high-value materials [ 140 ]. Finally, electromobility could also present some drawbacks. The high sales of EVs, mainly in countries, such as Norway, is the result of governments’ economic incentives. However, some of these incentives can have adverse effects (e.g., the exemption of toll charges has significantly reduced toll revenue [ 141 ]). Moreover, there have been 3.6% less public transportation passengers than the same quarter last year, according to the National statistical institute of Norway [ 142 ]. Although this issue might be due to several factors, we consider that these data can be directly related to impressive growth of EV sales in this country, since EV economic advantages and higher comfort can result in a reduction of public transport usage. 8. Conclusions In this paper, we analyzed the types of EVs, the technology used, the advantages with respect to the internal combustion engine vehicles, the evolution of sales within the last years, as well as the different charging modes and future technologies. We also detailed the main research challenges and open opportunities. Regarding EVs, batteries are a critical factor, as these will determine the vehicle’s autonomy. We analyzed several kinds of batteries, according to these features. We also presented the possible technologies that can be used in the future, such as the graphene, which is expected to be a solution that enables the storage of higher amounts of power, and charge in shorter periods of time. The EV could also benefit from this type of technology, reaching higher ranges, something that could help its adoption by drivers and users. The development of batteries with higher capacities will also favor the use of the fastest and most powerful charging modes, as well as better wireless charging technologies. The creation of a unique connector that can be globally used is another aspect that could benefit the deployment of electric vehicles. The EV will play a highly important role in the future Smart Cities, and having different charging strategies that can adapt to the users’ needs will be of special relevance. Therefore, future BMS should consider the new scenarios that were introduced by new batteries and Smart Cities requirements.

Impact of technology advancement in EV market and competition in EV market,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/why-the-automotive-future-is-electric,Why the automotive future is electric,"Why the future involves e-mobility | McKinsey Skip to main content Why the automotive future is electric September 7, 2021 | Article Mainstream EVs will transform the automotive industry and help decarbonize the planet. (24 pages) That hum in the distance is the sound of the concept of mobility changing—for the better. While challenges to the electrification of the vehicle parc persist, opportunities worth fighting for also lay ahead. This is particularly evident in cities, where emissions, congestion, and safety constitute major issues today. If the status quo continues, mobility problems will intensify as population and GDP growth drive increased car ownership and vehicle miles traveled. In response, the mobility industry is unleashing a dazzling array of innovations designed for urban roads, such as mobility-as-a-service, advanced traffic management and parking systems, freight-sharing solutions, and new transportation concepts on two or three wheels. Share About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Julian Conzade, Andreas Cornet , Patrick Hertzke , Russell Hensley , Ruth Heuss , Timo Möller , Patrick Schaufuss, Stephanie Schenk, Andreas Tschiesner , and Karsten von Laufenberg, representing views from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility. The current opportunity to transform the way we move fundamentally results from changes in three main areas: regulation, consumer behavior, and technology. Regulation. Governments and cities have introduced regulations and incentives to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility . Regulators worldwide are defining more stringent emissions targets. The European Union presented its “Fit for 55” program, which seeks to align climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and the Biden administration introduced a 50 percent electric vehicle (EV) target for 2030. Beyond such mandates, most governments are also offering EV subsidies. Cities are working to reduce private vehicle use and congestion by offering greater support for alternative mobility modes like bicycles. Paris announced it will invest more than $300 million to update its bicycle network and convert 50 kilometers of car lanes into bicycle lanes. Many urban areas are also implementing access regulations for cars. In fact, over 150 cities in Europe have already created access regulations for low emissions and pollution emergencies. Consumer behavior. Consumer behavior and awareness are changing as more people accept alternative and sustainable mobility modes. Inner city trips with shared bicycles and e-scooters have risen 60 percent year-over-year and the latest McKinsey consumer survey suggests average bicycle use (shared and private) may increase more than 10 percent in the post-pandemic world compared with pre-pandemic levels (See also “ The future of micromobility: Ridership and revenue after a crisis ,” July 2020). In addition, consumers are becoming more open to shared mobility options. More than 20 percent of Germans surveyed say they already use ride-pooling services (6 percent do so at least once per week), which can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and emissions (See also “ Shared mobility: Where it stands, where it’s headed ,” August 2021). Technology. Industry players are accelerating the speed of automotive technology innovation as they develop new concepts of electric, connected, autonomous, and shared mobility. The industry has attracted more than $400 billion in investments over the last decade—with about $100 billion of that coming since the beginning of 2020. All this money targets companies and start-ups working on electrifying mobility, connecting vehicles, and autonomous driving technology (See also “ Mobility’s future: An investment reality check ,” April 2021). Such technology innovations will help reduce EV costs and make electric shared mobility a real alternative to owning a car. Electrification will play an important role in the transformation of the mobility industry and presents major opportunities in all vehicle segments, although the pace and extent of change will differ. To ensure the fast, widespread adoption of electric mobility, launching new EVs in the market is an important first step. In addition, the entire mobility ecosystem must work to make the transformation successful, from EV manufacturers and suppliers to financers, dealers, energy providers, and charging station operators—to name only a few (Exhibit 1). 1 The future of passenger vehicle powertrains is electric; the transformation is ongoing The tipping point in passenger EV adoption occurred in the second half of 2020, when EV sales and penetration accelerated in major markets despite the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Europe spearheaded this development, where EV adoption reached 8 percent due to policy mandates such as stricter emissions targets for OEMs and generous subsidies for consumers. In 2021, the discussions have centered on the end date for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales. New regulatory targets in the European Union and the United States now aim for an EV share of at least 50 percent by 2030, and several countries have announced accelerated timelines for ICE sales bans in 2030 or 2035. Some OEMs have stated their intentions to stop investing in new ICE platforms and models and many more have already defined a specific date to end ICE vehicle production. Consumer mindsets have also shifted toward sustainable mobility, with more than 45 percent of car customers considering buying an EV. However, the continued acceleration of electrification is putting significant pressure on OEMs, their supply chains, and the broader EV ecosystem to meet these targets. This is particularly obvious with respect to setting up the required charging infrastructure. By 2035, the largest automotive markets will go electric Regulatory pressure and the consumer pull toward EVs vary greatly by region. Europe is mainly a regulation-driven market with high subsidies, while in China consumer pull is very strong despite reduced incentives. In the United States, EV sales have grown slowly due to both limited regulatory pressure and consumer interest, although the regulator trend is set to change under the new administration. On a global level, we expect EV (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) 1 Battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. adoption to reach 45 percent under currently expected regulatory targets. However, even this transformative EV growth outlook is far below what’s required to achieve net zero emissions. EVs would need to account for 75 percent of passenger car sales globally by 2030, which significantly outpaces the current course and speed of the industry. We believe Europe—as a regulatory-driven market with positive consumer demand trends—will electrify the fastest and is expected to remain the global leader in electrification in terms of EV market share. In addition to the European Commission target, which requires around 60 percent EV sales by 2030, several countries have already announced an end to ICE sales by 2030. In line with this, seven OEM brands have committed to 100 percent EV sales by 2030 within the European Union. In the most likely accelerated scenario, consumer adoption will exceed regulatory targets and Europe will reach around 75 percent EV market share by 2030. The European Union announced a zero-emissions target for new cars by 2035. Would you like to learn more about the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility ? Visit Our Insights on Future Mobility page China will also continue to see strong growth in electrification and remain the largest EV market in absolute terms. Uptake results from strong consumer pull, despite low EV subsidies and no official end date for ICE sales. However, the government’s dual-credit policy has led to an increased EV share in OEMs’ portfolios. Our adoption modeling yields a Chinese EV share above 70 percent for new car sales in 2030 in the accelerated scenario. In the United States, the Biden administration announced a 50 percent electrification target for 2030, strong investments in charging infrastructure, and more stringent fleet emissions targets. EV uptake will result mainly from regulatory support in California and other states that follow its CARB ZEV regulation. US OEMs support electrification targets and have declared ICE bans by 2035, meaning the United States will follow Europe and China in EV uptake with a small delay; it is expected to exceed current regulatory targets and reach 65 percent EV sales by 2030 in the accelerated scenario (Exhibit 2). 2 The e-mobility transformation will disrupt more than the automotive industry In the European Union, achieving the accelerated scenario of around 75 percent EV sales by 2030 will have implications for the entire EV value chain and ecosystem. In parallel, the industry must decarbonize the full lifecycle of vehicles to get closer to a net-zero target. Incumbent automotive suppliers need to shift production from ICE to EV components. Europe will have to build an estimated 24 new battery giga-factories to supply local passenger EV battery demand. With more than 70 million EVs on the road by 2030, the industry will need to install large numbers of public chargers and provide maintenance operations for them. Renewable electricity production needs to increase by 5 percent to meet EV charging demand. Finally, emissions from BEV production must decline, since BEVs currently have 80 percent higher emissions in production than ICE vehicles (Exhibit 3). 3 Electrification will cause a major shift in the entire automotive supply chain The transformation of the automotive industry toward electrification will disrupt the entire supply chain and create a significant shift in market size for automotive components. Critical components for electrification such as batteries and electric drives and for autonomous driving like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and radar sensors will likely make up about 52 percent of the total market size by 2030. Components only used in ICE vehicles such as conventional transmissions, engines, and fuel injection systems would see a significant decline to around 11 percent by 2030—about half the size of 2019 levels. Such a drastic shift will force traditional component players to adapt quickly to offset decreasing revenue streams. The scale of disruption will be significant: according to the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) in Munich, more than 100,000 jobs will change in the German automotive industry by 2030. That is roughly five to ten times the scale of jobs compared with the phaseout of coal power that Germany announced for 2038 (Exhibit 4). 4 Announced EU battery production will likely stay just ahead of demand Based on announced buildup plans, we expect a 20-fold increase in battery production capacity in Europe to 965 GWh by 2030. Assuming the full capacity is built by 2030, Europe should meet expected demand of 874 GWh. BEV passenger cars and commercial vehicles will drive 90 percent of this battery demand. While on paper announced capacities seem to follow and match demand, in reality temporary implementation risks will likely occur given giga-factory production issues, typically slow yield ramp-ups, fragmentation of the supply chain, and large inflexible OEM contracts. Thus, in an accelerated EV adoption case, battery demand would come very close to exceeding announced supply in the medium term. In the next ten years, we expect the mining industry to slow down and other geopolitical and supply chain crises to pop up periodically, leading to some short-term price spikes in commodities like nickel and lithium. Battery cell production is moving physically closer to vehicle assembly plants. While ten years ago almost all cells were imported from Asia, regional production hubs exist today in Eastern Europe, for example. Furthermore, multiple plants will go onstream in key vehicle-producing countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France and in low-carbon-emitting environments such as Norway and Sweden. In addition to incumbent battery cell players from Asia setting up locations in Europe, some entirely new companies are entering the space. One key development in battery sourcing involves the backward integration of OEMs from packs and modules up to cell production—mostly in the form of joint ventures with cell manufacturers. OEM backward integration plans result from their growing battery cell demand, the desire for control and certainty of supply, and the ambition to keep a significant part of vehicle value creation inhouse. OEMs are also seeking areas for differentiation, with battery technology, durability, and performance seen as key evaluation criteria for BEVs. Production of raw materials and battery components follow the localization trend of battery cell plants. However, there is a time lag and only some of the raw materials needed, which include nickel, cobalt, lithium, and graphite, are available for local sourcing in Europe. Companies must therefore compete globally to secure required volumes and do it sustainably in line with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. While all four commodities must ramp up quickly, with potential price variation in the future, nickel will likely be the commodity under the most pressure in the short to medium term (Exhibit 5). 5 Acceleration in charging infrastructure buildup needed In line with EV uptake, the buildup of charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to avoid becoming a potential bottleneck and limiting consumer-driven EV adoption. Building charging infrastructure in sync with the EV fleet will be essential in the coming decade. While first-generation EV buyers relied mainly on private charging (in 2020, 80 percent of EV buyers in Europe had access to private charging), the next generation will depend on public charging. More than 50 percent of Europeans will be living in multifamily homes without private charger access, and public chargers will ensure practicality of EVs for long-distance trips, which prospective EV buyers still consider a main concern. Likewise, regulatory processes to install chargers in private homes require simplification and production capacity for wall boxes must increase. Production scale-up and simplified regulation (in terms of shortened permit and building times) are also necessary for public chargers, in addition to the creation of demand-based coverage. We estimate the industry needs to install more than 15,000 chargers per week by 2030 within the European Union. Simplified regulations are needed to facilitate charger siting, since it can currently take up to three years to obtain approval for grid extensions for a fast-charging station. Ensuring the EU-wide coverage of public charging is essential to avoid having chargers located only in profitable locations. EVs are poised to command on average more than 5 percent of electricity demand in 2030 in Europe. It will be important to reduce charging during peak load periods through “managed charging” by controlling charging time, duration, and intensity with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology as an enabler. In a scenario with appropriately managed charging devices in place as well as incentives to charge during nonpeak hours, much of the customer impact on the electric grid will be mitigated (Exhibit 6). 6 Reaching net zero also means decarbonizing EV production There is a clear path to reducing CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions from passenger cars in operation. A recent International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) analysis stated that the shift from ICE to BEV would reduce total lifecycle CO 2 e emissions by around 65 percent based on the current average energy mix in Europe and by 83 percent with entirely green electricity. As the electricity supply evolves and charging with green energy for a larger fleet of EVs becomes feasible, materials and production will become the dominant sources of emissions in an EV’s lifecycle. Today an EV’s production generates an almost 80 percent higher emissions intensity compared with an ICE car, due mainly to the battery and the vehicle’s higher share of aluminum. Mobility’s future: An investment reality check Read the article When aiming to reduce material emissions, two main issues matter: Increasing recycled content. Replacing virgin/primary materials with recycled alternatives will save a large share of emissions associated with the initial generation of raw materials. Replacing 30 percent of primary material with recycled material can save 15 to 25 percent 2 The abatement rate depends on the level of required treatment of end-of-life (EOL) materials for reuse and the type of material. of production emissions. Recycled material use, however, comes with multiple challenges, including the reality that end-of-life (EOL) collection remains very immature, making it difficult to achieve an automotive-grade materials stream. Furthermore, multiple industries are interested in using recycled material to achieve their decarbonization targets, which will result in supply bottlenecks and the higher prices of several recycled materials. Shifting to green raw materials. Using primary materials produced in a low/no-carbon process enables high-grade materials with low emissions footprints. Examples of this approach include inert anode aluminum smelting via hydroelectricity or steel produced through hydrogen-based direct reduced iron in an electric arc furnace (H2 DRI-EAF steel). Around 80 to 90 percent of today’s typical material emissions can be eliminated with 2030 technologies. The main approaches involve decarbonizing the raw material refining processes by using renewable electricity, for example, and decarbonizing the forming as well as other high-energy manufacturing processes, also via electrification. While a switch in electricity resources is simple, the shift from today’s processes to manufacturing routes that avoid CO 2 e emissions altogether—rather than capturing or gradually reducing them—will require significant investments in plants and equipment. A predictable demand for green materials and long-term commitments between suppliers and buyers would help overcome this obstacle in the next decade. A determined approach to decarbonizing and combining these methods could produce vehicles with 10 to 30 percent of today’s production emissions by 2030—a challenging feat but necessary to fulfill the Green Deal aspiration. Nevertheless, decarbonizing the supply chain and achieving Scope 3 emissions reductions may cause vehicle costs to rise at a time when OEMs are trying to lower prices to boost consumer interest and achieve sustainable long-term margins (Exhibit 7). 7 A 55 percent transport emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 requires more drastic measures Current regulation and targets are not sufficient if the road transport sector wants to fully contribute to the 55 percent CO 2 e emissions reduction target by 2030 versus 1990 as required by the Fit for 55 program. However, passenger cars have one advantage over other industries from a decarbonization point: The zero-emissions option (e.g., the BEV) is cheaper than the current alternative (ICE) from a total cost of ownership perspective in some countries today and by 2025 at the latest in countries without incentives. This is not the case in most other industries, where decarbonizing results in higher costs for both producers and consumers. Share Our capabilities The McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM) aims to help all stakeholders in the mobility ecosystem navigate the future by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future mobility scenarios. Our view of trends are grounded in advanced multi-level driver based models that have been validated across industries and players. Each model is based on proprietary data and contributes to an integrated perspective on future mobility trends and scenarios including modal mix, miles traveled, vehicle sales, autonomy, powertrain electrification, battery demand, charging infrastructure, components, consumer behavior, and value/profit pools, etc. This charticle leveraged insights from multiple MCFM models and the broad MCFM Solution team. Please get in touch if you would like to learn more. However, with the average car age at ten years in Europe, it will take time for EV sales to have an impact at the parc level. The current regulation on sales is therefore not sufficient to meet the goal of a 55 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030. Closing this gap will require further measures targeting CO 2 e emissions of the vehicle parc. ICE vehicle kilometers traveled could be decreased by reducing private car kilometers, increasing shared mobility, and changing consumer perspectives on walking/biking. At the same time, the most efficient lever is to accelerate the ICE parc turnover and remove highly polluting ICE vehicles from the fleet with, for example, “cash-for-clunkers” programs for old ICE cars. Another way to reduce CO 2 e emissions from ICE vehicles is to increase the share of bio- and e-fuels as these have a low carbon footprint and are compatible with the existing ICE parc. However, the majority of bio- and e-fuels supply will be required to decarbonize marine/aviation and commercial road transport, for which only limited zero-emissions alternatives exist today (Exhibit 8). 8 Electric vehicles are coming, and we are on the right track regarding decarbonizing the transport sector, though more actions need to be taken. It is an industry transformation taking place at unprecedented speed. It is also crossing industry borders, involving energy, infrastructure, mobility, and automotive players. While a major challenge, it represents a huge opportunity for incumbents and new players to take a leading role in creating new multi-billion industries and jobs. The key will be to couple sustainability with economic viability through innovative technology and properly guided mobility transformation. Based on its diverse mobility landscape, its focus on sustainability and its proven technology leadership, Europe could emerge as a role model for other regions globally.

As the world transitions towards a sustainable future, the EV market is expected to foster innovation and drive growth in one of the economy’s crucial sectors. China stands at the forefront of this transformation with its thriving EV industry, offering foreign companies a plethora of opportunities driven by government incentives, environmental regulations, favorable policies, and technological innovation. We discuss investment prospects in China’s EV industry from a supply chain perspective in this industry brief. China’s leading position in the global EV industry China is the world’s largest new energy vehicle (NEV) market. According to the Ministry of Public Security , NEV ownership in China reached an impressive 13.1 million by the end of 2022, showcasing a substantial increase of 5.26 million vehicles (a remarkable growth rate of 67.13 percent) compared to 2021. Of this vast NEV fleet, electric vehicles accounted for an astounding 79.78 percent at 10.45 million. Find Business Support Build Your Asia Business with Turnkey Market Entry and Cross-Regional Support Enterprise search data show that China has more than 600,000 existing NEV-related enterprises. The year 2022 saw 239,400 newly added enterprises, an increase of 40.34 percent year-on-year. China’s new energy vehicle market has been developing rapidly in recent years, with growing market participants and competition in the industry. Major industry players include BYD Auto, Tesla China, SAIC-GM-Wuling, Aion, and Changan Automobile. These five players have more than 50 percent market share combined. Globally, China holds a dominant position in the EV supply chain, with over three-quarters of the world’s battery production capacity. The battery is among the most important components of an EV and accounts for 40 percent of the vehicle’s total price. Moreover, China houses more than half of the world’s processing and refining capacity for lithium, cobalt, and graphite, which are essential materials for making EV batteries. Specifically, China boasts 70 percent of the global production capacity for cathodes and 85 percent for anodes. China benefits from its inherent supply chain advantages, lowering costs in logistics, labor, and land management. Moreover, the large EV market enables economies of scale. Compared with Western markets in the US and Europe, China’s EV manufacturing industry has a cost advantage of 20 percent . State support The Chinese government has implemented supportive policies to bolster the growth of the EV industry. In line with the dual-carbon target, the State Council introduced the “ New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035) ” on November 2, 2020. This plan outlines a national strategy aimed at achieving a sustainable automotive future with reduced emissions. On June 21, 2023, China unveiled a substantial RMB 520 billion (US$72.3 billion) tax incentive package spanning four years. This package is designed to offer tax breaks for EVs and environmentally friendly vehicles. Notably, it provides a complete exemption from purchase tax for NEVs purchased in 2024 and 2025, with savings of up to RMB 30,000 (US$4,170) per vehicle. From 2026 to 2027, the exemption will be halved and capped at RMB 15,000 (US$2,078). The goal of this initiative is to stimulate growth in the automotive industry, especially in light of sluggish auto sales. Many regions have also introduced local initiatives. For instance, Shenzhen released the “ Guidelines for Financial Support to the High-Quality Development of New Energy Vehicle Industry Supply Chain ” in 2023. This proposal aims to enhance cross-border financial services to support NEV enterprises. Similarly, Shanghai issued the “ Implementation Plan for Accelerating the Development of New Energy Vehicle Industry (2021-2025) ” to drive the growth of the NEV industry in their region. Currently, in China, the distribution of the NEV industry is similar to that of the traditional automobile sector, with a concentration in key areas such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the central region. What does the EV industry supply chain look like and how does it work? The EV supply chain can be divided into three main stages of production activity: upstream, midstream, and downstream. The upstream industry involves the supply of raw materials and components for vehicle manufacturing. It encompasses extraction of minerals, namely lithium and cobalt, and manufacturing of major parts, including power battery, drive motor, and electronic control system. Most of these minerals are concentrated in a few countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Argentina, Chile, and Australia. The dispersion and concentration of these key materials make the global supply chain vulnerable and susceptible to disruptions caused by developments linked to geopolitics, shifts in trade alliances, and corporate consolidation. Find Business Support Find success in your next M&A deal with our on-the-ground blended M&A advisory services ⟶ China currently holds a prominent position in this stage, accounting for 75 percent of global lithium-ion battery production and 70 percent of cathode capacity. It stands as the leading refiner of battery metals globally and currently hosts a significant share of battery cell manufacturing capacity, anode, and electrolyte production as well as battery component manufacturing. The midstream industry covers the vehicle manufacturing process. China is a major player in this industry stage, with a robust manufacturing ecosystem in place for electric cars, commercial vehicles, and special-purpose vehicles. Supportive government policies and investments have contributed to the rapid growth of the automotive manufacturing industry, making China a leading force in the global electric vehicle market. The downstream segment of the EV supply chain comprises charging services and after-market services. This includes charging equipment infrastructure, automobile finance, insurance, trading, automobile repair and maintenance, and automobile dismantling and recycling. In recent years, the number of EV charging piles in China has been steadily increasing. Private charging piles are growing at an even faster rate compared to public charging piles. However, there is still a significant gap between the current number of charging piles and the market demand, leaving ample room for further development in the charging infrastructure. According to industry researchers , in 2020, China had a total of 1,751,000 charging piles—874,000 private charging piles and 807,000 public charging piles. By September 2021, the number of publicly owned charging piles rose to 1.044 million units. China’s EV supply chain development trends and overseas investment The existing automotive supply chain features a vertical distribution with Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 suppliers. Parts manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) generally take a tier-by-tier supply approach—Tier-1 suppliers support OEMs, while Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers support Tier-1 suppliers. Tier-1 suppliers, which may be subsidiaries or shareholding companies of OEMs, mainly supply system assemblies or modularized parts, while Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers mainly supply individual products, such as transmission gears, etc. With the accelerating pace of digitization and electrification, automobile products, as well as its operation and consumption, have changed dramatically. Specialized components, such as battery, power semiconductor devices, chips, system software, video sensors, LIDAR, etc., have become integrated sections of the supply chain. The automotive industry is transforming from a traditional manufacturing-assembly industry to a technology-intensive industry. Find Business Support Gain the Intelligence Needed to Make Informed Decisions for Your Asia Business In fact, EV companies work with a flatter and more flexible supply chain system, with a faster pace of product iteration, to adapt to market changes. Significantly, Tier-2 and Tier-3 suppliers can now directly supply new car manufacturers like Tesla, bypassing traditional Tier-1 companies . This has led to a rapid integration of these manufacturing and service suppliers into the automotive sector. Internet giants, such as Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, as well as electronic communications giants like Huawei and Xiaomi, are making their way into the field of new energy vehicles and intelligent driving cars through various means. These trends impact how traditional automotive enterprises operate. For example, BMW AG announced in 2022 that it will be procuring large cylindrical batteries for its upcoming generation of electric vehicles (EVs) from CATL and EVE Energy (a Tier-2 Chinese battery supplier). This collaboration signifies the growing trend of automakers partnering with battery manufacturers to produce batteries specifically for their own vehicles. However, such an ideal case may not always work out. Tier-2 and Tier-3 producers face significant challenges to remain competitive in the EV market. This is because established battery incumbents like CATL can offer preferential pricing due to their large-scale operations. Further, while there is a growing demand in China, the pace of capacity expansion seems to be outstripping actual demand, resulting in oversupply and forcing producers into fierce competition. As a result, it becomes crucial for these producers to find customers in non-China markets. Chinese battery suppliers venturing into overseas markets also hope to service the supply shortages in Europe and the US, besides establishing production facilities near OEM clients. In 2022, the total number of NEV exports reached 679,000 units, showing a significant year-on-year increase of 1.2 times. The demand outlook for the overseas market remains promising, driven by the accelerated shift of global automakers towards EVs and the ongoing lag in battery supplies. Leading Chinese suppliers are expected to maintain their technological and cost advantages over their global counterparts. Challenges in the EV supply chain The EV industry faces multifold challenges in both domestic and international markets. The demand for EVs in China has experienced a slowdown, as indicated by the leading industry association’s forecast of 35 percent growth in 2023, in contrast to the significant 90 percent growth observed in 2022. The domestic battery market in China has become saturated, leading to a decline in battery prices over the past decade. CATL, as a dominant player in the market, has offered lower prices to secure a fixed share of future orders. However, such a move towards a price war has instigated resistance from other producers. Further, the price surge of battery-grade lithium carbonate has pushed up the manufacturing costs of vehicle manufacturers. The fast growth of global demand for EVs, batteries, and materials may even drive up the price of EVs, not to mention the volatility resulted from a concentrated supply chain. These supply chain issues are compounded by hindering regulatory developments. One major obstacle is the shortage of chips, due to the CHIPS and Science Act , which has significantly impacted the entire automotive industry. Tight control over semiconductor chips have resulted in insufficient production and a structural imbalance, thereby driving up the production costs for vehicles. In addition, competing legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), aiming to strengthen the supply chain in the US, may bar Chinese companies’ direct investments in the US market. How foreign companies can participate in China’s EV industry? As the world’s largest EV market, driven by government incentives and environmental regulations, China presents an enticing opportunity for foreign investors. Supportive sectoral policies and a focus on technological innovation further encourage foreign investment. To succeed in this market, however, adaptation to local preferences and the establishment of robust partnerships are essential. Find Business Support Ready to Enter the China Market? Our Experts Can Advise on Business Strategy and Incorporation Under China’s latest Negative Lists for Foreign Investment Access , there are no special restrictions on foreign investors to invest in the EV industry. That is to say, foreign investors can build wholly foreign owned enterprises (WFOEs) in specific areas of the EV supply chain, such as EV auto parts, batteries, chargers, and related industries. For example, Tesla’s success with its Gigafactory in Shanghai showcases the impact of increased foreign competition in China’s EV market. WFOEs encourage technological transfer and innovation. Yet, with the rise of Chinese domestic companies and challenges in the global supply chain structure emanating from geopolitical factors, foreign enterprises are advised to carefully consider market entry. Another approach that foreign companies can adopt is to establish joint ventures with Chinese partners. Joint ventures enable collaboration in multiple areas, such as manufacturing, technology development, and distribution. This can involve forming alliances for specific projects, sharing research and development efforts, or jointly exploring new business opportunities. Further, foreign companies can invest directly in Chinese EV startups, manufacturers, or related infrastructure projects. Investors can also engage in technology transfer agreements with Chinese partners, sharing technological expertise, patents, or licensing agreements to facilitate the development and production of EVs in China. Such collaboration can help foreign companies gain access to the Chinese market while benefiting from local manufacturing capabilities.

Steven Brown , Pamela J. Loprest Display Date September 28, 2018 The Urban Institute will cohost the Reimagine Communities Symposium in Plano, Texas, on October 3, 2018. In a series of posts this month, we’ll explore the theme of the conference: how we can harness technology to create more inclusive communities and create pathways to economic opportunity. “The robots are coming.” “No jobs are safe.” “The way we work is coming to an end.” These fears around automation and technology’s impact on jobs continue to grow as innovations have the potential to change the employment landscape. Although millions of jobs could be lost as a result of new technologies , millions of jobs will also be created (it’s still unclear whether there will be enough new jobs ). Concerns about robots, automation , and artificial intelligence (AI) miss that the advent of technology is more likely to change jobs, not eliminate them. In manufacturing, companies are experimenting with having floor and line workers use mechanical exoskeletons to reduce strain and fatigue when lifting heavy objects. And in sales, representatives will need to become more capable with online marketing and engagement to adapt to customer preferences. Technology is changing the way we work, but concerns about which jobs are lost and which are gained—and who those changes affect—are important in considering whether people will have the opportunity to shift from working in the jobs of yesterday to the jobs of tomorrow. Which jobs are poised for growth, and which face declining demand? The evidence is clear that technological change has reduced the need for routine mechanized work and increased both the demand and pay for high-skilled technical and analytic work. The impact of automation and artificial intelligence is an acceleration of a trend decades in the making. Switchboard operators have recently been replaced by phone and interactive voice response menus, and many grocery store clerks have been replaced with self-checkout machines. With advances in AI, reports claim that truck drivers , paralegals , and even surgeons might see their occupations upended by changing technology. In this environment, tech jobs could seem like the only occupations with guaranteed job growth. But they’re not the only ones. Although there is a growing need for developers and data scientists, jobs in personal care and the medical industry are expanding even faster. The need for more home health aides—as well as growth in other health-related occupations—is driven largely by the aging baby boomer population entering retirement and by technological advances that increase the effectiveness of care. Research has shown that the need for basic data processing skills and manual labor will decline over the next decade, while cognitive, social, and emotional skills will be more in demand. These skills—such as solving complex problems, working in teams, giving advice, and demonstrating leadership—facilitate more human interaction. Many growing health- and service-related jobs require skills that robots and automation can’t replace. How these changes could affect income, gender, and racial and ethnic disparities An important difference between the jobs being lost and the ones being gained is the difference in pay. Many of the lost jobs are middle-skill occupations that pay middle-class wages (the 2017 median annual wage was $37,690 ). The tech-related jobs replacing those positions are much higher paying, while such jobs as home health aide and personal care aide pay less. Many workers in the occupations that are losing jobs do not have the skills to easily move into those higher-paying jobs. Jobs like information security analysts and software developers require at least a bachelor’s degree, and most statistician jobs require a master’s degree. Few of the fastest-declining occupations require anything higher an associate’s degree. The difference between declining jobs and growing ones also affects racial or ethnic and gender equity. Women make up nearly 90 percent of word processors and typists—the job that will see the biggest decline over the next decade. Women of color are overrepresented in this occupation, with black and Latino workers holding 40 percent of these jobs. Growing occupations at the higher end of the pay scale tend to employ more men and fewer people of color. Men fill 80 percent of both information security analysts and app developer jobs, while people of color make up 20 percent and 12 percent of those occupations, respectively. And in growing occupations that pay less (home health aides and medical assistants), women fill 90 percent of jobs, and people of color make up more than 40 percent of medical assistants and 50 percent of home health aides. The skills and education needed for future high-paying jobs continue to increase, while jobs like home health aides require less education, pay less, and provide fewer opportunities for career advancement. Given persisting racial and ethnic gaps in educational attainment , these differences could lock many people of color out of the opportunity provided by technological advances in the labor market. Ensuring technology’s effect on work benefits everyone Technological advancements are changing the way we work, reducing the need for some occupations and expanding the need for others. Jobs that aren’t experiencing rapid change in growth are still seeing rapid change in technological adoption, which requires workers in those fields to learn new skills. Along with these changes could come advances in productivity, creating high-paying, high-quality employment for people in the position to take advantage of the growth of these good jobs. But there is also a risk, especially among those without advanced degrees, that people will lose jobs paying middle-class wages and get locked out of better jobs. Efforts to make these changes are under way. Communities are collaborating within their local workforce systems to create reskilling programs targeted to the needs of local employers, and expanding apprenticeship programs have been shown to create employment opportunities for women. National nonprofits such as Opportunity@Work and Code2040 have developed workforce development and training programs targeted to people of color and others underrepresented among the high-paying, fast-growing jobs. Although these efforts are promising, employers, employees, educators, and policymakers need to ensure that more people can pursue these opportunities and to ensure that technology improves the way we all work.

A September executive order in the state would require all new cars and passenger trucks sold in the state to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Source: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News via Getty Images. This is the third piece of a four-part series exploring the rise of electric vehicles and their impacts on the global economy, from the auto and power industries to oil and mining sectors. The love affair between cars and oil is losing its spark. The surging popularity of electric vehicles stands to rattle fossil fuel markets, with energy experts anticipating an erosion of oil demand for transportation around the globe. At the same time, the electric vehicle revolution has the potential to generate additional demand for natural gas as a power source for plug in cars. . Overview: Electric vehicle surge resonates across global economy Mining: Battery disruptors are jolting metal supply chains Oil and gas: Electric vehicle growth to sever oil from key market Utilities: Rise of electric vehicles heightens grid-integration imperative . Under one scenario, U.S. oil and liquids demand could drop by about 25% from 2019's 20.3 million barrels per day — before the COVID pandemic — to an estimated 15.3 million b/d in 2050, according to an ""Inflections"" base case from IHS Markit research. The Inflections case projects that global oil demand peaks in 2036 and then declines slowly.The outcomes for both oil and gas depend heavily on government policies and EV incentive schemes, according to observers. That uncertainty around the pace of electric vehicle adoption is reflected in the wide-ranging estimates from researchers and market participants. ""We see that as a potential outcome depending on how strong policies are to decarbonize,"" Jim Burkhard, IHS's head of research for oil markets, energy and mobility said. ""It's all policies."" Aggressive EV adoption would eat into oil demand Both independent and oil company forecasters expect that aggressive electric vehicle adoption would cause oil use for transportation to crumble. IHS's low-carbon policy scenario projects that U.S. oil demand for transportation could drop to 7 million b/d in 2050. ""We see that as a potential outcome depending on how strong policies are to decarbonize,"" Burkhard said. ""You have voters and consumers, powering the heavy hand of government to retire fossil fuel equipment ... to retire before the end of its useful life, in order to decarbonize. That's the difference."" The timeline over which a government-driven push towards EVs remains highly uncertain, though, Burkhard noted. ""Is the U.S. government going to say you cannot use an oil-powered car in 2040? Or, you cannot sell an oil-powered car in 2033?"" Burkhard asked. ""We're not there yet. Could we be? It's a possibility."" There are some key catalysts Burkhard sees potentially driving an accelerated transition. For instance, d evastating storms with significant humanitarian consequences could alter the public' cost-benefit analysis. Norway's Equinor ASA sees an aggressive drop-off in oil demand. Assuming current trends play out, Equinor predicts global demand for oil for transportation will drop 47% between 2018 and 2050 due to improvements in fuel efficiency and electric vehicles. Equinor sees current moves toward electric vehicles as reflective of a combination of car manufacturers' efforts to meet emissions standards and technological advancements improving the vehicles themselves. The company said earlier this year that it expects electric vehicles to ultimately become competitive on costs without subsidies. EVs not a silver bullet for cutting oil use In the IHS base case, national interests take priority over international climate change cooperation on greenhouse gas emissions and growth in the developing world offsets climate change efforts by the developed economies. That said, this Inflections scenario still projects a ""remarkable"" electrification of transport around the world, although acknowledges that challenges around developing ""ever larger battery supply chains"" temper the transition pace. The EIA, too, sees electric vehicle sales only nibbling away at gasoline as a fuel for cars and trucks, and fuel efficiency standards playing an equal or greater role in cutting U.S. demand for oil for transportation over the next decade. EIA's latest annual energy forecast reference case, which assumes no major political or technological changes, predicts 9% more oil will be consumed by the U.S. transportation sector in 2050 than in 2020, even as electric vehicle sales explode. In the near term, the effect of electric vehicles on the U.S. fossil fuel markets appears negligible, according to Joshua Linn, a senior fellow at the energy think tank Resources for the Future. Electric vehicle additions may — because of the way federal fuel standards are calculated using fleet averages — even increase oil and gasoline demand, Linn said. ""We have the federal [Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or] CAFE and greenhouse gas standards that are determining the overall emissions rate of vehicles,"" Linn said. ""If you sell more electrics, that means you can sell more gas-consuming SUVs."" Even if electric vehicles come to entirely dominate the transportation space, Exxon Mobil Corp. is expecting little change in global oil use. The oil major predicts that oil use for transportation will decline slowly but overall oil demand will continue to rise as crude is needed for industry and petrochemicals. ""If every car sold in 2025 was an EV, leading to every single passenger vehicle in the world being an EV by 2040, the global demand for oil and gas would be the same as it was in 2010,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said, citing Exxon's 2018 energy outlook. Gas producers, pipelines could see opportunity amid transition A transformation in the transportation sector stands to benefit natural gas, albeit not directly as a transportation fuel. The decades-old dream of the late Chesapeake Energy Corp. CEO Aubrey McClendon and his fellow shale gas revolutionaries that natural gas would be a widely used transportation fuel will probably not come true. Even though the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects that natural gas use for transportation in the U.S. will increase steadily over the first half of the century, the fuel's direct role in the segment ultimately remain at ""relatively low levels."" But natural gas will benefit from any transition to electric vehicles as gas is part of the electric power dispatch stack, according to analysts at credit research firm CreditSights. Increasing electric vehicle adoption ""will drive higher grid demand for power. This results in higher natural gas demand in the near and medium term,"" CreditSights said in a note to clients, calculating that if new car sales by 2030 are EVs in the U.S., that would translate to about a roughly 2-3%, or 72 TWh, rise in grid demand. CreditSights' projected that that increase would translate to about 0.7 Bcf/d in incremental gas demand, under the assumption that half of that power demand would be met with gas and a 7,000 heat rate new-build plant. With that, natural gas pipeline operators and processors will be insulated from any shift brought on by electric vehicles, CreditSights wrote. Long-term contracts protect their businesses through this decade, and further out there remain relatively few replacements for the natural gas liquids that they produce and sell to industry, according to the research firm. ""Natural gas pipelines, LNG export infrastructure and NGL assets appear best positioned for the energy transition,"" CreditSights said. ""Natural gas will continue to be a fossil fuel that is complementary to the energy transition for a very long time, and while replacements like electric vehicles are positioned to impact gasoline/diesel demand, replacements for NGLs and the petchem process to make plastics simply aren't viable."" Even still, some midstream and downstream oil and gas companies are gearing up to respond to a changing market, with a few operators already making investments to capture parts of the EV value chain. Days after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for all-electric cars to make up 50% of new sales in the country by 2030, refiner Phillips 66 announced plans Aug. 9 to purchase a 16% stake in Novonix Ltd., which supplies materials for lithium-ion batteries. Phillips 66 will feed its existing business into Novonix's synthetic graphite manufacturing facility and expand that plant's capacity. Analysts at energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. flagged the electric vehicle potential in this move immediately, representing a possible avenue for oil and gas companies to find new niches: Phillips 66 produces specialty coke, which is used to make anode material for batteries, putting the company in a position that ""supports the development of a fully domestic supply chain for sales into the rapidly growing U.S. EV market."" IHS Markit is subject to a merger with S&P Global pending regulatory and other customary approvals.

Federal subsidies and policy favoring deeper discounts for Indian-made electric two-wheelers as well as a boost for localized ACC battery storage production are other growth drivers for the Indian EV industry. EV sales have surged more than 2,218 percent over the past three years, with over 4,42,901 electric cars sold in FY 2023 (till December 9), as compared to 19,100 sold in FY 2020. The global automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm shift at present in trying to switch to alternative/less energy intensive options. India, too, is investing in this electric mobility shift. The burden of oil imports, rising pollution, Russia-Ukraine war escalating price inflation, as well as international commitments to combat global climate change are key factors motivating India’s policies to speed up the transition to e-mobility on one hand and growing consumer appetite on the other. Electric vehicle industry in India: Growth targets The Indian automotive market is slated to be the third largest by 2030 in terms of volume. Catering to a vast domestic market, reliance on the conventional modes of fuel intensive mobility will not be sustainable. In an effort to address this, federal policymakers are developing a mobility option that is “ Shared, Connected, and Electric ” and have projected an ambitious target of achieving 100 percent electrification by 2030.

According to an independent study by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) , the EV market in India will be a US$206 billion opportunity by 2030 if India maintains steady progress to meet its ambitious 2030 target. This would require a cumulative investment of over US$180 billion in vehicle production and charging infrastructure. In 2021, the Indian EV industry attracted US$6 billion in investment and is becoming steadily more attractive to private equity/venture capital investors. Another report by India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA) projects that the Indian EV market will grow at a CAGR of 36 percent till 2026. The EV battery market is also projected to grow at a CAGR of 30 percent during the same period. Meanwhile, India’s EV market is estimated to grow at 49 percent CAGR in the 2022-2030 period in a business as usual scenario as per the IESA report. Overall, by 2030, the EV industry is set to create 10 million direct jobs and 50 million indirect jobs ( IVCA-EY-Induslaw report ). India is also witnessing the rise of a sizeable EV financing market, with Niti Aayog projecting it to be worth US$50 billion by 2030. Launch of ‘e-AMRIT’ portal: One-stop platform for information on electric vehicles India rolled out the website e-AMRIT – https://www.e-amrit.niti.gov.in/ – at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow , which will function as a one-stop destination for all information on electric vehicles. It addresses key concerns about the adoption of EVs and their purchase – such as charging facility locations and EV financing options as well as information about investment opportunities, government policies, and available subsidies for drivers and manufacturers. Existing EV ecosystem in India and investment outlook Regardless of the country’s ambitious targets, India’s EV space is at a nascent stage. However, looking at it differently – India offers the world’s largest untapped market, especially in the two-wheeler segment. 100 percent foreign direct investment is allowed in this sector under the automatic route. The federal government is also prioritizing the shift towards clean mobility, and recent moves to amend the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) II scheme to make electric two-wheelers more affordable, is a case in point. Under the phase two of the FAME scheme, as on July 11, 2022, about 469,315 electric vehicles were supported through demand incentives amounting to about INR 18.69 billion. Approvals have been granted to 6,315 electrical buses and 2,877 EV charging stations sanctioned in 68 cities across 25 states/Union Territories. 50 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), both start-ups and established manufacturers, have registered and revalidated their 106 EV models. There are 1,576 charging stations sanctioned for set-up across nine expressways and 16 highways. In addition, multiple production-linked incentive schemes intend to create a local manufacturing ecosystem to support goals around greater adoption of electric mobility transport. This is sought to be achieved by incentivizing fresh investments into developing indigenous supply chains for key technologies, products, and auto components. Production-linked incentive schemes In May 2021, the government rolled out a Production-Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for ACC Battery Storage Manufacturing , which will incentivize the domestic production of such batteries and reduce the dependence on imports. This will support the EV industry with the requisite infrastructure and will significantly cause a reduction in cost of EVs. On September 15, 2021, the government approved a PLI Scheme for the automobile and drone industry, which intends to incentivize high value advanced automotive technology vehicles and products, including ‘green automotive manufacturing’ (see Cabinet press release here ). The PLI Scheme for the auto sector is open to existing automotive companies as well as new investors who are currently not in the automobile or auto component manufacturing business. The scheme has two components: i) Champion OEM Incentive Scheme: This is a ‘sales value linked’ scheme, applicable on battery electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles of all segments. ii) Component Champion Incentive Scheme: This is a ‘sales value linked’ scheme, applicable on advanced automotive technology components of vehicles, completely knocked down (CKD)/ semi knocked down (SKD) kits, vehicle aggregates of 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, and tractors etc. India’s EV sales witness over 2000% surge from 2019 to 2022 Over the previous three years, EV sales have increased by more than 2,218 percent; in FY 2023 (until December 9), over 4,42,901 electric cars have been sold, compared to 19,100 in FY 2020. Additionally, according to official data, as of December 9, about 64 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of EVs have registered, and 7,47,000 EVs had been sold as part of FAME India Phase II. More than half of these EVs are three-wheelers and are used for commercial transportation, with roughly 8,00,000 two-wheelers being used for personal transportation. India now has 5,151 EV charging stations that are in use. Emerging market players Many leading battery producers like Amara Raja Batteries , have picked up the cue from theses incentives to orient new investments into green technologies, including in lithium-ion batteries. In April 2022, one of the world’s most energy dense batteries at 54MWh, developed by a Bengaluru-based battery startup – Pravaig , was acquired by a European renewable energy company, Eren Groupe , for its storage applications. Having a high density implies that the battery gives more power per atom, proving to be cost-effective when compared with alternatives such as sodium-ion or aluminum air. The developers of the battery have also informed that it takes just 30 minutes to fully charge a battery. This new acquisition by a European company will not only give boost to domestic manufacturing, but will also make pave way for making EVs more economical, considering batteries usually account for 35-40 percent of the total cost. Further responding to the opportunity that India’s EV industry presents, many leading industry players like OLA Electric Mobility Pvt, Ather Energy, and Mahindra Electrics are rapidly growing their market presence. Moreover, certain states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are rolling out innovative and timely investor-friendly policies besides building necessary infrastructure. Find Business Support Where to locate your investment Recently, the American electric vehicle and clean energy company Tesla Inc. marked its entry into India by incorporating its subsidiary, Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt Ltd, in Bengaluru. In February 2021, Ather Energy , India’s first intelligence EV manufacturer moved its US$86.5 million factory from Bengaluru (Karnataka) to Hosur (Tamil Nadu). Ather Energy’s factory is said to have an annual production capacity of 0.11 million two-wheelers. In March 2021, Ola Electric, the subsidiary of the unicorn Indian ride-hailing start-up, also announced that it would be setting up the world’s largest electric scooter plant in Hosur (which is a two and a half-hour drive from Bengaluru) over the next 12 weeks, at a cost of US$330 million, and aiming to produce 2 million units a year. By 2022, Ola Electric wants to scale up production to pump out 10 million vehicles annually or 15 percent of the world’s e-scooters. Meanwhile, indicative of the market interest for electric two-wheelers in India, Ola Electric reportedly clocked INR 11 billion (US$149.26 million) in sales over a two-day purchase window. Ola Electric’s website allows scooters to be reserved and the next sales window opens November 1. The electric scooters are manufactured at the Ola Futurefactory near Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu. On September 9, 2021, Greaves Cotton announced its entry into the multi-brand electric vehicle retail segment under the brand name AutoEVMart. According to reports, this platform will present consumers with a wide range of electric vehicles to choose from – from Ampere Electric to other brands in the EV space. Thus, AutoEVMart will serve as a marketplace for electric vehicles in India, offering e-two-wheelers and e-three-wheelers, among others, along with EV accessories. Greaves Cotton envisions first-of-its-kind multi-brand retail stores for clean tech or electric mobility in Bengaluru. Recently, Sterling and Wilson Pvt Ltd (SWPL), India’s leading engineering, procurement, and construction company announced its entry into the electric mobility segment in India. It has signed a 50-50 joint venture with Enel X, to be incorporated on April 1, 2021, to launch and create innovative charging infrastructure in India. There have also been positive developments in the expansion of charging infrastructure across the country – states like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Telangana are setting impressive targets for the deployment of public charging infrastructure to increase uptake of electric vehicles in the country. Find Business Support Are you interested in learning more about the EV industry in India? The key reasons why these states are doing better than others are local fiscal sops, better logistics, an investor-friendly government policy, business facilitation through easier access to authorities, supply chain connectivity, and the availability of suitable land. Karnataka was the first state to introduce a comprehensive EV policy and has emerged as a hotspot for EV businesses in India, both in EV and EV ancillary manufacturing as well as R&D segments. Tamil Nadu is also leaping forward at a commendable pace, owing to its supply ecosystem, larger land parcel, proximity to ports, and proactive investor support through administrative portals like Guidance Tamil Nadu . Nevertheless, while growth in the EV industry is on an upward tick, it has much ground to cover to be able to realize the government’s ambitious 2030 target. The COVID-19 pandemic not only slowed the industry’s progress, but also dampened overall market demand. Still, market sentiment has retained positivity in some segments, accelerating in 2022 in the aftermath of escalating oil prices amid the Russia-Ukraine war. During the April-September 2022 period, India recorded sales of 277,910 electric two-wheelers, which was a 404 percent increase over the same period last year that saw 55,147 units sold. In H1 FY 2022-23, 18,142 electric cars were sold, registering a 268 percent growth.

These targets, if achieved, could lead to a net reduction of 14 exajoules of energy and 846 million tons of CO2 emissions over the deployed vehicles’ lifetime. Electric vehicles sold until 2030 can cumulatively save 474 million tons of oil equivalent over their lifetime, worth US$207.33 billion. This will help India fulfil its global commitments to lower carbon emissions and increase use of cleaner sources of energy and transportation as required by the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and EV30@30. Policy measures Federal policy Several fiscal and non-fiscal measures have been put in place to facilitate the adoption of electric mobility. They are as follows: National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 (NEMMP): It was launched in 2013 by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) as a roadmap for the faster manufacture and adoption of EVs in India. FAME Phase I : As part of the NEMMP 2020, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme was notified in April 2015, to promote the manufacture of electric and hybrid vehicle technology. It has mainly focused on four aspects – demand creation, technology platform, pilot projects, and charging infrastructure. For demand creation, incentives have mainly been disbursed in the form of reduced purchase prices. FAME Phase II : Launched in 2019 for a period of three years, this scheme has an outlay of US$1.36 billion to be used for upfront incentives on the purchase of EVs as well as supporting the development of charging infrastructure. FICCI has asked for continuation of FAME II till 2025 , along with short-term booster incentives to enhance demand. This second phase focuses on supporting electrification of public and shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies, about 7,000 e-buses, 5,00,000 e-three wheelers, 55,000 e-four wheeler passenger cars and one million e-two wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure is also supported. Amendments to FAME Phase II : On June 11, 2021, the Ministry of Heavy Industry announced further amendments to the FAME II scheme to give a boost to EV demand among consumers ( see official press note here ). The scheme was extended by two years, to March 31, 2024. Under the revised policy, the subsidy per electric two-wheeler ( Indian-made ), which is linked to the battery size, has been increased to INR 15,000 (US$204.60) per Kilowatt-hour (KWh) from INR 10,000 (US$136.40) KWh. Furthermore, electric two-wheeler manufacturers can now give discounts of up to 40 percent to consumers, which is a significant raise from the previous cap of 20 percent. The eligibility criteria for these electric two-wheelers to qualify for subsidy under the FAME II scheme include a minimum range of 80 km on single charge and a minimum top speed of 40 km per hour. Nine cities with a population of over four million will receive support for electric buses – Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Surat, and Pune. Ministry of Power: It has clarified that charging EVs is considered a service, which means that operating EV charging stations will not require a license. It has also issued a policy on charging infrastructure to enable faster adoption of EVs. The revised consolidated Guidelines & Standards for Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles was promulgated on January 14, 2022 . Exhaustive in scope, these guidelines include provisions for a) individual owners of EVs and b) for public charging stations (PCS) infrastructure. It covers land use and access, power tariffs, state and central government roles, timelines for providing connectivity for installation of PCS, among other concerns. In November 2022, the Power Ministry amended the consolidated guidelines: see here . – Public charging stations shall have the feature of prepaid collection of service charges with the time of the day rates and discount for solar hours. – A Committee under Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to recommend to the State Government the ceiling limit of service charges to be levied. This Committee shall also recommend “time of the day rate ” for service charges as well as the discount to be given for charging during solar hours. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways: It has announced that both commercial as well as private battery-operated vehicles will be issued green license plates. It has also notified that all battery operated, ethanol-powered, and methanol-powered transport vehicles will be exempted from the commercial permit requirement. Department of Science and Technology: It has launched a grand challenge for developing the Indian Standards for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure. Niti Aayog: The National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage has been approved by the cabinet, and the inter-ministerial steering committee of the Mission will be chaired by the CEO of Niti Aayog. The Mission aims to create a Phased Manufacturing Program (PMP) for five years till 2024, to support setting up large-scale, export-competitive integrated batteries and cell-manufacturing giga plants in India, as well as localizing production across the entire electric vehicle value chain. On April 20, 2022, the think tank released a draft battery swapping policy and invited comments from relevant stakeholders by June 5, 2022. The draft policy, which will be valid till March 31, 2025 from the date of its notification, is specifically designed for battery swapping systems to be used for two-wheelers and three-wheelers. States/union territories policy Over 27 states and UTs have formulated strategy plans for transforming mobility to provide their citizens with safe, inclusive, economic, and clean transport options. While some states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have had a head start due to preplanned public policies, targeted investor incentives, as well as support infrastructure, other states too have drafted policies to stimulate market demand and create infrastructure.

Challenges faced by EV industry Insufficient charging infrastructure: In 2019, there were only 650 charging stations in India as against over 0.3 million in China. Lack of sufficient charging infrastructure is one of the primary reasons why customers often refrain from purchasing EVs. High costs: Along with the range anxiety (kms/charge), another major concern among the potential customers is the current high price of EVs. As compared to lower-end (internal combustion engine) ICE cars, electric cars in the same segment tend to be more expensive. This is mainly because of the higher cost of technology used in the EVs, which constitutes a substantial portion of the cost, not leaving much scope for other features usually available in premium cars. It is expected that in future, with increased R&D and market competitiveness, the price factor will be rationalized to suit the price sensitivity, which in India is a primary factor influencing purchase, especially in the lower-end car segment. With the recent announcement of subsidies, the price rationalization of EVs in the two-wheeler segment is on cards. Since the government’s fast-changing priorities are now biased towards sustainable, clean electric mobility, industry watchers expect a similar push towards easing adoption of other electric vehicles like cars and buses soon. Limited options: Since it is still a budding industry in India, customers have a very limited range of products to choose from. Increased investment in the sector will make it more competitive in due time and this will help create further demand. Lower mileage: Since the industry is young, there is immense scope for R&D. As of today, EVs in India are not cost competitive to an average customer as internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles prove to be more cost effective. Higher dependency on imports: Reliance on imports of battery as well as other components is also one of the factors adding to the cost of EVs in India. Grid challenges: Another concern is regarding the price of charging EVs at private charging stations once EVs become mainstream. According to Brookings India, projections for 2030 show that even with a fair penetration of EVs, the increase in demand for electricity is likely to be about 100 TWh (tera watt-hours) or about four percent of the total power generation capacity. So, increasing methods of power generation are necessary to meet that growth in demand. Key takeaways Ultimately, the scope of India’s EV market growth rests on availability of capital for original equipment manufacturers, battery manufacturers, and charge point operators as well as improvements to infrastructure and diversified options for consumers. Realizing India’s EV ambition will also require an estimated annual battery capacity of 158 GWh by FY 2030, which provides huge investment opportunities for investors. Enabling policy support measures are a critical need at this juncture. The government appears to be aware of this. It has been rolling out incentives to boost market demand in priority segments like electric two-wheelers, and localizing production of key components like ACC battery storage as well as electric vehicles and auto components through respective PLI schemes. Besides, several Indian states have now passed EV policies intending to attract industry investments and make EV adoption more viable proposition for the consumer market.

Ford Electric Vehicle Strategy U.S. Electric Vehicles Product and Software News Charging and Energy Services Industrialization + Production EV 101: Towing EV 101: Batteries EV 101: Cold Weather Driving Photo Gallery First Responder Information Contact Ford Electric Vehicles Ford Electric Vehicle Strategy The electric era is here, and Ford is in the midst of implementing an ambitious, comprehensive plan to make the transition to an electric lifestyle – or commercial fleet, for that matter – easy. The company started by electrifying its most iconic products – the Mustang, F-150 and Transit – which quickly helped elevate Ford to the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. in 2022. In addition to offering zero-emissions versions of its most popular vehicles, the company is harnessing electrification to deliver more of what customers love about them: performance, capability and productivity. The electric Mustang Mach-E brings the 0-60 mph thrills Mustang is famous for, in a sleek new package brimming with the latest technology and software updates. The F-150 Lightning brings stunning innovation, technologies and capabilities to the F-Series, America’s best-selling truck**, combined with the power, payload and towing capability that is the hallmark of all Built Ford Tough trucks. The E-Transit – an electric version of America’s best-selling van* – is smart and connected, and will arm fleet owners with technology solutions like a high-speed in-vehicle data architecture and cloud-based services to offer new ways to optimize fleet performance. The electric Explorer crossover -- unique for Europe -- offers an outstanding digital experience with a fully loaded infotainment system, 15-inch movable screen, wireless app integration and advanced driver assistance, and can be ordered later in 2023. An electric Puma , a sports utility-inspired compact crossover for Europe, coming in 2024. The new E-Transit Custom is the EV successor to Europe’s best-selling van with uncompromised capability, new customer experiences and full Ford Pro support. A new E-Transit Courier compact van in Europe strengthens features a significantly larger and more flexible load area, and full backing from Ford Pro’s connected services deliver unmatched productivity. A key part of Ford’s goal to drive the adoption of electric vehicles is to target the large market for fully electric commercial vans and pickups. Ford is planning to bring the benefits of electric vehicles to these customers with an accessible price point, improved productivity, and lower cost of ownership. Along with a variety of home charging solutions, the Ford BlueOval Charge Network is North America’s largest public charging network†, with more than 106,000 chargers. Built-in charging solutions, such as cloud-connected navigation, route customers to nearby charging stations, recommend where to charge on trips and provide easy access and payment via FordPass for a seamless customer experience. And with more than 2,700 EV-certified dealers across all 50 states – plus 644 EV-certified commercial vehicle centers – Ford stands ready to serve customers and help people transition to electric vehicle ownership. Ford has electric vehicle manufacturing footprints across the world. This includes four plants in North America, including as the new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan and BlueOval City , an automotive manufacturing ecosystem in Tennessee, and two BlueOval SK battery plants in Kentucky, creating a total of 11,000 new American jobs. These facilities will reimagine how electric vehicles and batteries are designed, built and recycled – all Built for America. This electrification strategy is a core component of Ford’s goal to achieving carbon neutrality globally by 2050. Ford is the only full line U.S. automaker committed to doing its part to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and working with California for stronger vehicle greenhouse gas standards. Additionally, Ford is investing significantly to accelerate research and development of battery and battery cell technology. The company announced the establishment of the Ford Ion Park global battery center in southeast Michigan, where it will use state-of-the-art equipment to pilot new manufacturing techniques that will allow Ford to quickly scale breakthrough battery cell designs with novel materials once the company vertically integrates battery cells and batteries. Ford also increased its investment in Solid Power, an industry-leading producer of all-solid-state batteries for electric vehicles. These batteries show great promise and are designed to power longer range, lower cost and safer electric vehicles using existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure. *Based on total U.S. reported sales (2022CY). **Based on 1977-2022 CY total sales. †Based on original equipment manufacturers (OEM)/automotive manufacturers that sell all-electric vehicles and have publicly announced charging networks.  Department of Energy data used. FordPass, compatible with select smartphone platforms, is available via a download.

For customers considering an electric truck, F-150 Lightning checks all three boxes – without any tailpipe emissions. When it comes to towing specifically, more than half of F-150 Lightning customers have signaled their towing intent by selecting the available Max Trailer Tow Package. The package allows for an available maximum towing capacity of 10,000 pounds for special configurations to go along with 775 lb.-ft. of nearly instant electric torque. The numbers speak for themselves, but the experience of towing with gas trucks or F-150 Lightning comes with a few undeniable facts: Whether gas or electric, driving distance while towing is similarly impacted by weather, temperature and geography. Speed and trailer aerodynamics also play a role: the faster you drive and the larger the frontal area of the trailer, the greater the impact on range A significant difference between gas and electric trucks is that gas trucks can begin with approximately twice the range (or more) compared to the average electric truck, depending on configuration Temperature extremes impact electric trucks more than gas, though F-150 Lightning can help mitigate those effects and maximize range by pre-conditioning prior to departure while the vehicle is plugged in. Pre-conditioning uses energy from the vehicle charger or outlet – instead of the battery – to warm or cool the battery and the cabin So what does this mean for a customer? Well, if you’ve driven gas-powered trucks for years, towing with F-150 Lightning should feel a bit different as power delivered by dual electric motors provides a smooth and consistent experience with maximum torque available off the line. You’ll also have to recharge more often than you would refuel. The energy density of fuel allows an F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid to achieve up to 704 miles of EPA-estimated range, compared to the top EPA-estimated range of F-150 Lightning, which is 320 miles. And – at least right now – there are approximately three times as many gas stations as electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. For commercial customers, this is an important consideration for job sites in rural areas or for extreme use cases when getting the job done. “The F-150 Lightning is an ideal companion for many F-150 customers and businesses who want to tow. For customers towing longer distances with payloads nearing the max, Ford has you covered with models like the F-150 PowerBoost Hybrid,” said Darren Palmer, VP, battery electric vehicle programs, Ford Model e. “Your power. Your choice.” The F-150 Lightning can tow, even cross country. For customers who choose the benefits of an electric truck over trip speed, like Mark Eakin, an F-150 Lightning owner and retired oceanographer, a towing trip from Maryland to California is achievable. “As a scientist, I understand that there will be an effect on range because of various factors and wind was a particularly important one during my journey,” he said. “Planning in advance helps and the Ford technology is a big enabler in the planning.” The technology Eakin mentions starts with Intelligent Range, which collects vehicle data like speed, ambient temperature, available battery energy, driver habits, climate control use and route topography to determine how much electrical energy drivers use in real time. The system also uses cloud computing to gauge energy use from other similar types of Ford electric vehicles operating in similar situations, resulting in more accurate vehicle range calculations over time. Helpful Ford technology also works seamlessly with public charging stations. For commercial customers, Ford Pro offers end-to-end charging solutions and experts to help customers understand if F-150 Lightning is right for their needs, including extreme use cases. “Customers don’t need to worry about estimating range with all the different factors in play, because our intuitive Ford technologies do that for them, and suggest the best options for charging along their route,” Palmer said. “Once at a charger, available Plug and Charge means a customer can plug in, while the truck manages charger authentication and integrated payment.” ### Graphics View More Next Previous Permalink Select EV Towing Photos View More Next Previous Permalink Select EV 101: Batteries The Difference Between LFP and NCM Batteries – And Why It Matters In the world of electric vehicles, there are two main types of batteries used to power their performance: nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). Ford is planning to assemble both kinds of batteries in the U.S. and will offer customers a second battery technology as they shop for an EV.* That’s a big deal because adding another battery chemistry to Ford’s EV lineup means the company can scale production more quickly while also making its vehicles more accessible for customers. But what does it mean for your electric vehicle’s performance – and how do you know which battery is best for you? &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Offering both chemistries allows Ford customers to choose an electric vehicle with unique battery performance characteristics that are most aligned with their needs. NCM Benefits Higher power rating and energy density. Can travel long distances and handle greater loads. Hold up well in colder conditions. Set the max AC charge level to 90 percent to maintain battery health; charge to 80 percent recommended on DC fast chargers May be a welcome option for customers who desire long range. LFP Benefits Tend to be more durable with a longer projected lifespan. Can tolerate more frequent and faster DC fast charging. Use fewer high-demand, high-cost materials. Set the max AC charge level to 100 percent and charge to the max at least once per month to maintain range accuracy; charge to 80 percent recommended on DC fast chargers. May be a welcome option for customers who have known range requirements, like business owners who run the same routes and charge frequently, or people who primarily need their EV for shorter daily trips and commutes. So where and when will you see these batteries deployed across the Ford EV lineup? Starting in the second half of 2023, Ford will be introducing its standard range Mustang® Mach-E® vehicles powered by LFP batteries. These vehicles even bring some performance enhancements: The eAWD configuration of the Mustang Mach-E SUV will gain an increased 45 horsepower, while targeted EPA range estimates for standard range RWD configurations increase from 247 miles to 250 miles and standard range eAWD configurations rise from 224 miles to 226 miles.** In 2024, LFP batteries will also be introduced to the F-150® Lightning® truck, and Ford will continue to integrate the batteries into a variety of affordable, next-generation EV passenger vehicles and trucks under development, most of which will be assembled in the U.S.* The combination of LFP and NCM batteries will help Ford deliver an annual run rate of 600,000 electric vehicles globally by 2024 and eventually 2 million globally. *Assembled in the USA with domestic and foreign parts. **Based on full charge. USA EPA-targeted range based on analytical projection consistent with US EPA combined drive cycle. Actual range varies with conditions such as external environment, vehicle use, vehicle maintenance, lithium-ion battery age and state of health. EV 101: Cold Weather Driving Tips to help maximize the range of your EV in extreme weather Ford EVs have been tested in extreme cold conditions, enduring months of real-world winter driving in Alaska and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The batteries have been subjected to temperatures as high as 140°F to as low as minus 40°F in Ford’s atmospheric test chambers. However, all-electric vehicles experience energy decreases in cold temperatures due to battery cell chemistry. Temperatures below 40°F cause the electrolyte fluid to become sluggish, limiting how much power is available to discharge and how quickly the vehicle’s battery can charge. As EV customers across the United States and Canada experience winter with their new EVs, Ford wants to help make them aware that in low temperatures they could see a significant reduction in range, which is normal. With temperatures that can drop below freezing in northern parts of the U.S., here are some tips for how you can best prepare your EV to maximize range in extreme weather conditions: 1. Park your EV in a garage: Garage storage helps to ensure that harsh weather conditions outside do not affect your vehicle, and maintaining a warmer storage temperature than outdoors will aid in vehicle and battery performance. 2. Plug in your EV when parked for extended periods of time: Keeping the vehicle plugged in works to maintain battery health and helps to prevent excessive discharge scenarios. 3. Precondition your vehicle before use to warm the battery while plugged-in: By preconditioning your vehicle, you’re allowing the battery to warm to optimum temperature before use, positively affecting range and driving dynamics. For Ford EV owners, preconditioning can be scheduled using the vehicle’s SYNC touchscreen or from the comfort of your couch using the FordPass app. 4. The best way to keep warm: If equipped, use the heated seats and steering wheel as primary heat to reduce energy consumed by HVAC. 5. Turn off the heat when charging your EV: When charging, turn off the heater if possible, or lower the temperature enough to remain comfortable (especially when using DC Fast Charging). 6. Use your vehicle’s Ford Onboard Navigation to locate a DC Fast Charging station: In doing this, the vehicle preconditions by warming up the battery within 20 miles of your destination. This allows the battery to accept a charge faster in cold weather, getting you back on the road quicker. 7. Keep driving speeds moderate as high speeds use more energy: Higher speeds can negatively impact range in all types of weather. For best results, Ford recommends limiting your speed when possible. 8. Ensure your tires are at the proper pressure: Proper tire pressure not only works to maximize range, it also works to ensure that the correct amount of tire surface area is gripping the road. Tires that are over or underinflated can lead to range degradation along with safety and performance issues. You can find the proper tire pressure figures for your vehicle using either the sticker on the door jamb, the tire pressure app on your center screen, or the owner’s manual shortcut also located using the center screen. 9. Plan your route and be prepared for whatever winter brings: Before leaving, identify all the charging locations on your route and plan your stops strategically. As with all winter driving, expect the unexpected. Make sure you have a plan in the event you run into poor conditions.
