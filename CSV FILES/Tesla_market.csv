Tesla sold 50% of the electric vehicles (EVs) purchased in America last quarter. Americans bought more than 300,000 EVs for the first time last quarter. Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time. Sales will likely cross the 1 million mark before Thanksgiving. EV Sales Up Nearly 50% From One Year Ago Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. EVs made up 7.9% of all car sales between July and September – a record and a jump of 0.7% from second-quarter numbers. EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. Tesla Sales Growing, But So Is List of Competitors But the big news may be Tesla’s shrinking margin. Tesla sales grew by 19.5% last quarter. But so many competitors have entered the mix that even growing sales mean a shrinking lead. Tesla controlled 75% of the EV market as recently as the second quarter of last year . The company’s long-promised Cybertruck may be nearing production , which could help it regain some market share. But Tesla’s problem isn’t that any one company is doing well. It’s that so many competitors are entering the race. Some Competitors Grew 200% or More Most automakers posted sizeable gains in EV sales over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes, and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. Fourteen new EV models that did not exist one year ago made at least one sale last quarter, including the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Silverado EV . The new Chevy EVs had very low sales – just an initial few. The German luxury makes – Audi, BMW, and Mercedes – continue rapidly increasing EV model sales. In Q3, BMW and Mercedes EV sales more than triple year-ago levels, while Audi posted an EV sales gain of 94%. The flood of EVs into the market is just beginning. Kelley Blue Book analysts expect the number of available EVs to double by 2027. While automakers are offering more EVs by the day, consumer interest is growing more slowly. Slowly growing infrastructure and the gradual rollout of government incentives mean car shoppers are less enthusiastic about EVs than automakers at the moment . But adoption of new technologies follows a cycle where this trough is normal .

Hyundai Motor, including Kia, overtook GM in U.S. sales of EVs but remains a far second compared with industry leader Tesla. Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, has grown its lead over the legacy automakers to roughly 300,000 all-electric vehicles, according to data from Motor Intelligence. In this article F TSLA .FKRX300 GM Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT A Tesla Model Y is seen on a Tesla car lot in Austin, Texas, on May 31, 2023. Brandon Bell | Getty Images DETROIT – Legacy automakers continue to promise big increases in production and sales of battery-electric vehicles, but their efforts so far have done little to change the highly watched, emerging market. Despite notable upticks in sales compared with a year ago, industry leader Tesla remains the top EV seller and has grown its lead over legacy automakers. It is roughly 300,000 units ahead of its closest competitors Hyundai Motor and General Motors through the first half of this year, according to Motor Intelligence. That compares with a roughly 225,000 gap in the first half of 2022. The auto data firm reports that Tesla, which does not release sales by region, is estimated to have sold 336,892 vehicles to retail and fleet buyers in the U.S. during the first half of the year, a 30% increase from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Hyundai — including the Kia brand that's owned by the same parent company — increased its EV sales by roughly 11% during that time to 38,457 units. GM, which was second in EV sales through the first quarter, more than quadrupled electric car and truck sales to 36,322 units through June compared with a year earlier. And Volkswagen more than doubled EV sales to 26,538 units sold through June. Ford Motor, which was second in EV sales last year behind Tesla, rounded out the top five spots with sales of 25,709 vehicles through June, according to Motor Intelligence. Ford's EV sales were only up 12% compared with a year earlier, as the automaker took downtime to retool some plants such as a Mexican facility that produces its electric Mustang Mach-E crossover. ""Our EV sales continue to grow. Improved Mustang Mach-E inventory flow began to hit at the end of Q2 following the retooling of our plant earlier this year, which helped Mustang Mach-E sales climb 110% in June,"" Andrew Frick, Ford vice president of sales, distribution and trucks, said Thursday in a sales release. Tesla sales Tesla's 30% year-over-year sales growth during the first half of the year was fueled by production at a new plant in Texas coming online and ramping up. However, that hasn't been enough to keep up with the EV market's overall growth. Tesla's market share of U.S. EV sales dropped nearly 10 percentage points from a year ago to represent 60% of electric vehicles domestically sold, according to the data from Motor Intelligence. Tesla's decline in market share comes as more competitors enter the field, resulting in overall market growth. EV sales in the U.S. increased roughly 50% through June compared with the first half of 2022. Legacy automakers, as well as newer companies such as Rivian Automotive , have been attempting to ramp up production of all-electric vehicles but many of their outputs remain small. Aside from the top slots, only five others have between 1% and 4% U.S. market share, according to Motor Intelligence. A host of others are under 1%. Tesla's global deliveries were more than 889,000 EVs during the first half of the year, including 466,140 vehicles during the second quarter. Its production is expected to continue to grow, as Tesla is aiming to produce at least 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2023. CEO Elon Musk has told shareholders that the Texas factory should be the highest-volume production auto plant in the U.S. once it is fully ramped up. Last year, Musk said the Texas plant was aiming to produce half a million vehicles annually by the end of 2023. Hyundai rises, GM disappoints Hyundai's second-place position is especially notable considering that its vehicles don't qualify for federal EV tax incentives of up to $7,500 unless they're leased. Those incentives , which are complex, are meant to benefit EVs that are produced in North America. EVs from Hyundai are currently imported from overseas. The South Korea-based automaker has been leaning into that leasing loophole under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. The Hyundai brand has increased leasing of its EVs from roughly 2% to begin this year and has now hit more than 30%, according to Hyundai Motor America CEO Randy Parker. ""It's not an even playing field, and we're certainly not happy about it. But those are the deck of cards that have been dealt and we're trying to play that deck as best as we can,"" Parker said Wednesday during a call with reporters. Hyundai Ioniq 5 on display at the New York Auto Show, April 13, 2022. Scott Mlyn | CNBC GM's EV sales thus far have been disappointing, especially when it comes to new models with the automaker's ""Ultium"" battery technologies. The automaker has been criticized for not ramping up production of its newest EVs such as the GMC Hummer and Cadillac Lyriq quickly enough. The vast majority of GM's EV sales during the first six months of the year were of its outgoing Chevrolet Bolt models, which will be discontinued later this year. GM CEO Mary Barra reiterated last week at the Aspen Ideas Festival that the company's output of newer EVs has been constrained due to domestic production of its batteries that's taking longer than expected. Barra has said GM plans to catch Tesla in sales by mid-decade, as the automaker rolls out more mainstream EV launches later this year such as the Chevrolet Silverado , Blazer and Equinox. It's also launching a new electric delivery van and a $300,000-plus bespoke Cadillac EV called the Celestiq in 2023. The Detroit automaker has said it plans to produce 150,000 EVs this year for the U.S. market. — CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report. Disclosure: NBCUniversal News Group, of which CNBC is a part, is the media partner of the Aspen Ideas Festival. Correction: GM was second in EV sales through the first quarter of this year. A previous version of this article misstated that timeframe Mary Barra, GM chair and CEO, speaks during the unveiling of the Cadillac Celestiq electric sedan in Los Angeles, Oct. 17, 2022.

[+] screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 14, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images Consumer credit reporting and data analytics company Experian just released its Automotive Market Trends for Q3 2022. The report covers vehicles in operation (VIO) by model year, segment, age and market share, as well as other U.S. light duty vehicle data through September 30, 2022. The report is full of good data, but I was especially interested in its analysis of electric vehicles (EVs). At the end of Q3, pure EVs made up 0.69% of the overall light duty vehicle registrations, with hybrid vehicles contributing another 2.4%. Although overall vehicle registrations were down from a year ago, EV registrations increased significantly since Q3 2021. In Q3 2022, EV registrations accounted for 5.6% of all vehicle registrations, compared to 3.1% a year ago. Tesla continues to dominate EV sales, with 65.4% of the EV market. However, that is down from 68.2% in 2021 and 79.4% in 2020. With the market growing, Tesla is still rapidly growing its vehicle sales despite its loss of market share. But, there are reasons for concern. Tesla failed to meet Q3 estimates with 343,000 vehicles delivered versus street estimates of 358,000. The company blamed the highly challenging environment for transport and logistics, and there is certainly truth in that statement. However, next year we may start to see the “Twitter effect” come into play. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed his purchase of Twitter on October 27, 2022. Since then, he has made a series of controversial decisions — which many view as missteps. I won’t review the decisions he has made, but they have generally been derided by liberals and cheered by conservatives. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best Travel Insurance Companies By Amy Danise Editor Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans By Amy Danise Editor That may have market consequences for Tesla. A recent Pew Research poll showed that Democrats are two and a half times as likely as Republicans to consider purchasing an EV. Consider, for example, that staunchly Democratic California alone had more than a third (35.9%) of all new EV registrations from January through September of this year, versus 7.4% for Florida and 6.4% for Texas. It’s anecdotal, but I have heard multiple people say that because of Musk’s Twitter decisions, they would no longer consider buying a Tesla. I know of people who actually did cancel their Tesla orders. In fact, numerous people have shared their cancelations on Twitter. I don’t think there’s any doubt that there will be some repercussions. There are a couple of things in Tesla’s favor, though. One is that Tesla’s competitors are still racing to catch up. There just aren’t enough alternatives to meet demand if a substantial fraction of potential Tesla customers decide to look elsewhere. Further, there are still supply chain constraints that continue to hamper the ability of car makers to ramp up production. The other thing in Tesla’s favor is that some are in favor of what Musk has done at Twitter, and that may make them more likely to support him by purchasing a Tesla. But, the fact that Republicans are far less likely to purchase an EV means that Tesla will likely lose even more market share as Musk’s supporters and detractors vote with their pocketbooks. Musk’s Twitter controversies have undoubtedly been a factor in this year’s share price decline for Tesla. Year-to-date, shares have fallen by 62.5%, versus a 33.4% decline in the Nasdaq. Since Musk’s October acquisition of Twitter was completed, Tesla shares are down by 33.4% versus a mere 3.9% decline in the Nasdaq. That kind of move in such a short time is clearly not simply a result of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. This may all lead to a much steeper decline in Tesla’s market share in 2023, depending on how much of the void competitors can fill. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

In the first seven months, thanks in part to the somewhat chaotic price reductions , the Elon Musk -led car manufacturer saw 390,377 new registrations in the US, a 50 percent increase compared to the same period last year, and now has a 59.5 percent share of the American EV market. Chevrolet is in second place, with nearly 40,000 new electric vehicle registrations between January and July and a 6 percent market share, and Ford occupies third place in the list, with 33,955 new EV registrations in the first seven months and a 5.2 percent share. Gallery: 2021 Tesla Model Y 27 Photos As a whole, the all-electric car industry saw registrations rise to 655,986 in the aforementioned period – an increase of 67 percent – for a total market share of 7.2 percent. The entire light-vehicle market recorded about 9.1 million new registrations, Experian data shows. When it comes to Tesla , it had 60,769 new registrations in July alone, while all the other EV manufacturers combined had 48,566 vehicles registered in the US. At the same time, data from J.D. Power shows Tesla had an estimated market share of 8.5 percent in the light-vehicle segment in July, crediting the Austin-based firm for driving EV adoption nationwide.

At the same time, the Model S fell 51 percent to 8,439 units, while the Model X went down 14 percent to 14,462 new registrations. In the case of Chevrolet, the soon-to-be-retired Bolt EV and Bolt EUV were responsible for all of the new registrations except for 25 new Silverado EV pickups, with July being the first month when the all-electric pickup entered the new registration data. Ford’s EV share fell from 6.9 percent to 5.2 percent, with a total of 33,955 vehicles registered in the January-July period. The F-150 Lightning pickup accounted for 11,883 units, surpassing the Rivian R1T which saw 7,611 new registrations. As always, let us know what you think about this in the comments section below.

Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November. Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. Most automakers posted sizeable gains over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. In Q3, 14 new EV models that did not exist one year ago were in the mix, including Chevrolet Blazer and Silverado EVs. (The new Chevy EVs had very low sales – just an initial few to mark a Q3 launch). The EV market is transforming, to be sure. Electric vehicle sales accounted for 7.9% of total industry sales in Q3, a record and up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% in Q2. As Cox Automotive has been reporting, higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the U.S. market. EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters. EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. The long-promised Cybertruck may reverse the downward trend, although competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet will likely impact Tesla’s electric pickup volume potential. The German luxury makes – Audi, BMW, and Mercedes – continue to rapidly increase sales of EV models. In Q3, BMW and Mercedes EV sales more than triple year-ago levels, while Audi posted an EV sales gain of 94%. Among automakers selling internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV products, Audi, BMW and Volvo had the richest mix of EVs in Q3. BMW had the highest proportion, with over 15% of its sales being EVs, followed by Audi and Volvo, with over 12% of their sales being EVs, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. Mercedes, Porsche and VW all had an EV mix in excess of 10% last quarter. Q3 EV SHARE OF TOTAL BRAND SALES In 2020, just three years back, EV sales in the U.S. passed 250,000 for the first time. This year, the market will jump past 1 million. In Q3, Tesla remains the undisputed leader in EV sales, with Ford a distant #2 on the list, selling just over 20,000 EVs. Most analysts expect a flood of new EVs in the coming three years, with the number of available EV products likely to double by 2027. With this changing landscape, EV sales volume growth in the U.S. is expected to continue. Of late, product availability has grown exponentially, while consumer acceptance has grown in a more linear fashion. Those trends will likely continue, making for some very interesting market dynamics in the years ahead. Change is never easy.

In 2022, Tesla captured over 50% of the US EV market. EV sales are expected to exceed 1.9 million units in 2023. New Delhi, London, S an Diego, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul – April 4, 2023 Passenger electric vehicle* (EV) sales** in the US grew 54.5% YoY in 2022, according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s Global Passenger Electric Vehicle Model Sales Tracker . Battery EV (BEV) sales grew by almost 70% YoY to account for more than 80% of all EV sales in 2022. Tesla remained the market leader in 2022 with more than 50% market share. Tesla sold more cars than the other 17 automotive groups combined. Commenting on the market dynamics, Research Analyst Abhik Mukherjee said, “Although overall passenger vehicle sales in the US declined in 2022, EV sales increased to represent 7% of all US passenger vehicle sales. Tesla is dominating the US EV market while other automotive giants like Ford , General Motors , Stellantis , Volkswagen and Hyundai are struggling to provide strong competition. But still, we are seeing new players like Lucid Motors , Karma , Fisker and Vinfast entering the US EV space, underlining the market’s potential. Moreover, with the recent price cuts by Tesla and all versions of Tesla’s Model Y becoming eligible for the EV tax credit subsidy , it is expected that Tesla will take an even higher market share.” The top 10 best-selling EV models accounted for 69% of total EV sales in the US. All four Tesla models were present in the top-10 bestseller list for 2022. Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 and Kia’s EV6 made a significant impact, entering the list within a year of their US launch. Discussing the market outlook, Research Director Jeff Fieldhack said, “High interest rates due to macroeconomic pressures during 2022 negatively affected vehicle sales in the US. In 2023 , EV sales are expected to reach over 1.9 million units but only if economic headwinds do not severely impact the market, like in 2022. With automotive OEMs and battery manufacturers joining hands to set up battery manufacturing plants across the US, the battery supply chain is expected to become smoother and component costs will moderate, making the potential US EV market greater than 10 million per year by 2030 .” Background Counterpoint Technology Market Research is a global research firm specializing in products in the TMT (technology, media, and telecom) industry.

But when you had close to 100% of the market, there’s only one way to go, and that’s down. For years now, Tesla has dominated the electric auto market in its home country. It is expected that Tesla’s hold on the market will erode as more EV options hit and help grow the US market, but for now, the US EV market is still extremely dependent on Tesla’s production and deliveries. For the entire year of 2020, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States . In 2021, that number went down to 69.95% , but that’s still impressive with EV delivery volumes significantly increasing throughout the year along with Tesla’s prices. Now in 2022, new data released by S&P Global Mobility today shows that Tesla still dominates with 65% of market share this year through the first nine months: Although U.S. electric vehicle registrations remain dominated by Tesla, the brand is showing the expected signs of shedding market share as more entrants arrive. Much of Tesla’s share loss is to EVs available in a more accessible MSRP range – below $50,000, where Tesla does not yet truly compete. Out of the more than 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022 in the US, nearly 340,000 were Tesla vehicles. When you look into the luxury EV market (over $50,000), Tesla’s dominance is even clearer with 85% market share. S&P Global Mobility predicts that the number of EV models available in the US will grow from 48 at present to 159 by 2025. Tesla is expected to only contribute a single additional vehicle, the Cybertruck, to those 100+ new EV models, but S&P says that it will still only marginally affect Tesla, which is expected to still grow its volume during that time. Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence for S&P Global Mobility, commented: Before you feel too badly for Tesla, however, remember that the brand will continue to see unit sales grow, even as share declines. The EV market in 2022 is a Tesla market, and it will continue to be, so long as its competitors are bound by production capacity. However, some of those new EV models from other automakers are expected to reach high-volume production within the next three years and start challenging Tesla’s dominance in the US. In fact, S&P thinks that Tesla’s US EV share will drop to below 20% of the overall market by 2025 which means that either Tesla will have to falter or the rest of the industry will have to go all out in the next three years. Or more likely both. Electrek’s Take Top comment by CMG30 Liked by 17 people It's a near mathematical certainty that Tesla will continue to lose market-share for the next several years, no matter how many times they double production.  It's just what it is.  The only time to be worried is if Tesla starts to have an inventory backlog. View all comments When you basically own the whole market, there’s only one way, and that’s down. So if I were Tesla, I wouldn’t worry too much. It’s all about production volume. Whichever automaker is able to produce compelling EVs in large volume is going to dominate, and so far, that’s Tesla. There’s no doubt about it. It’s important to note that Tesla dominates the EV market in the US right now, but the EV market is itself just about 5% of the US light vehicle market. By the time there are a few dozen EV programs that have production capacities near a million units, the EV market will take a majority of market shares. Add Electrek to your Google News feed.

Photo : Shannon Stapleton ( Reuters ) By Michelle Cheng Published January 24, 2023 Tesla’s share of the US market for electric vehicles has been comfortably north of 60% since 2018. But its lead has been slipping. Though still the dominant player, Tesla’s market share is down from 70.5% in 2021 to 63.5%, according to data from S&P Global Mobility, which tracks registrations of new EVs. “Tesla’s position is changing as new, more affordable options arrive, offering equal or better technology and production build,” the data firm notes . Advertisement T esla accounted for four of the top five new EV vehicle registrations in the US in 2022, according to S&P Global Mobility. General Motors’s more affordably priced Chevrolet Bolt also is in the mix. Tesla became the EV market leader in 2018. The company unseated Nissan—one of the early electric pioneers , with its Nissan Leaf—after the launch of its first mid-priced vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, in August 2017, said Tom Libby, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. Tesla’s market share continued to climb in 2020 with the launch of its second medium-priced vehicle, the Model Y; both are popular Tesla models . Advertisement But since 2020, the market has changed, with interest for EV adoption picking up as a warming climate becomes more apparent, and with established automakers revving up their production of electrics across the price spectrum.  The Chevrolet Bolt, for example, starts at $26,500 . Meanwhile, luxury EVs from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi–as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning—are coming for the high end of the EV market. Tesla cuts prices to compete for EV sales In recent weeks, Tesla has made deep cuts on the prices of its vehicles globally, signaling weakened demand for a company that rarely discounts and has long boasted not needing to advertise or pay for endorsements. In China, where Tesla gets nearly a quarter of its revenue , the company slashed prices in October and again at the start of January. Quartz found that prices in Hong Kong were slashed as much as 20% on Model Y type. Meanwhile, in the US, Tesla doubled its discounts on key models at the end of December, which happened even before the arrival of the $7,500 federal tax incentive that is now in effect in the US. The US tax incentives are intended to spur more EV sales and the building of domestic supply chains for EV parts, which could pose trouble for Tesla’s competitiveness. The EV industry has long relied on China for EV batteries and the processing of certain minerals that go into the batteries such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Advertisement Tesla’s fourth-quarter EV production and delivery numbers, disclosed on Jan. 3, missed Wall Street’s expectations , with the manufacturer pointing to covid-related and logistical challenges . Like other carmakers, Tesla is grappling with a slowdown in overall vehicle demand and rising borrowing costs as central banks try to tame inflation. Musk’s divided attention after buying Twitter for $44 billion in October also has had some investors worried. Tesla’s shares ended 2022 down 65% for the year. Will Tesla be able to retain loyalty? It was only a matter of time before other manufacturers would start to catch up to Tesla; the question now is whether Tesla will be able to keep an edge over its competitors. Advertisement Tesla’s stock is up 33% since the start of 2023, which may suggest that price cuts are keeping investors satisfied . Tesla also arguably has the advantage of scale . In 2022, the company started production at two new factories —in Austin, Texas, and in Brandenburg, Germany—and ramped up production in Shanghai. It’s also reportedly looking to boost production at its factory in Fremont, California . On Jan. 25, Tesla will report its quarterly earnings, which will signal to investors how the manufacturer is faring in the current macroeconomic environment and demonstrate the effect of the price cuts. 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2024-02-19 16:02:30

Much of Tesla's share loss is to EVs available in a more accessible MSRP range – below $50,000 , where Tesla does not yet truly compete. New EV entries nibbling away at Tesla EV share, according to S&P Global Mobility Regardless of brand or price point, early S&P Global Mobility data suggests consumers moving to electric vehicles in 2022 are largely doing so from Toyota and Honda – brands which have been unable to keep their internal combustion owners loyal until their own brands begin to participate more significantly in the EV transition. While both Japanese companies built a US legacy with phenomenal fuel economy and powertrain technologies – including electrification through hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell electric vehicles – both have been caught flat-footed in the context of 2022. S&P Global Mobility conquest data for Tesla's Model 3 and Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq5, and Chevrolet Bolt show strong captures of buyers from the two leading Japanese brands. Tesla's challenge So far, most EVs continue to be acquired for higher MSRPs and by buyers with higher incomes than the demographic profile for total light vehicle registrations--in part because most EVs are Teslas. Of more than 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022, nearly 340,000 were Teslas. The remaining volume is divided, very unevenly, among 46 other nameplates. However, the trends may change as the number of EV buyers becomes more robust. Tesla's position is changing as new, more affordable options arrive, offering equal or better technology and production build. Given that consumer choice and consumer interest in EVs are growing, Tesla's ability to retain a dominant market share will be challenged going forward. S&P Global Mobility predicts the number of battery-electric nameplates will grow from 48 at present to 159 by the end of 2025, at a pace faster than Tesla will be able to add factories. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk confirmed (again) during a recent earnings call that the company is working on a vehicle priced lower than the Model 3, though market launch timing is unclear. Tesla's model range is expected to grow to include Cybertruck in 2023 and eventually a Roadster, but largely the Tesla model lineup in 2025 will be the same models it offers today. (Tesla is also planning to deliver a commercial semi-truck by the end of 2022, but it would not be factored into light-vehicle registrations.) ""Before you feel too badly for Tesla, however, remember that the brand will continue to see unit sales grow, even as share declines,"" said Stephanie Brinley , associate director, AutoIntelligence for S&P Global Mobility. ""The EV market in 2022 is a Tesla market, and it will continue to be, so long as its competitors are bound by production capacity."" Tesla has opened two new assembly plants in 2022 and is looking for the site of its next North American plant. Tesla today is the brand best equipped for taking advantage of the immediate surge in EV demand, though manufacturing investments from other automakers will erode this advantage sooner than later. The competition Throughout 2022, EVs have gained market share and consumer attention. In an environment where vehicle sales are limited by inventory and availability, EVs have gained 2.4 points of market share year over year in registration data compiled through September – reaching 5.2% of all light vehicle registrations – according to S&P Global Mobility data. The nascent stage of market growth leaves others competing for volume at the lower end of the price spectrum. New EVs from Hyundai, Kia and Volkswagen have joined Ford's Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Bolt (EV and EUV) and Nissan Leaf in the mainstream brand space. Meanwhile, luxury EVs from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Polestar, Lucid, and Rivian – as well as big-ticket items like the Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Hummer, and Chevrolet Silverado EV – will plague Tesla at the high end of the market. With the Model Y and Model 3 combined taking 56% of EV registrations, the other 46 vehicles are competing for scraps until EVs cross the chasm into mainstream appeal. (A recent S&P Global Mobility analysis showed the Heartland states have yet to embrace electric vehicles.) ""Evaluating EV market performance requires looking through a lower-volume lens than with traditional ICE products,"" Brinley said. ""But growth prospects for EV products are strong, investment is massive and the regulatory environment in the US and globally suggests that these are the solution for the future."" Production volumes today are restricted by factory capacity, the semiconductor shortage and other supply chain challenges, as well as consumer demand. But the issue of production capacity is being addressed, as automakers, battery manufacturers and suppliers pour billions into that side of the equation. Though there are many signals suggesting consumer demand is high and that more buyers may be willing to make the transition – and to do so faster than anticipated even a year ago. But consumer willingness to evolve to electrification remains the largest wildcard. Looking past Model Y and Model 3, no single model has achieved registrations above 30,000 units through the first three quarters of 2022. The second-best-selling EV brand in the US is Ford. However, Mach-E registrations of about 27,800 units are about 8% of the volume Tesla has captured, according to S&P Global Mobility data. Tesla has four of the top five EV models by registration; in the sixth through 10th positions are the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV, Hyundai Ioniq5, Kia EV6, Volkswagen ID.4 and Nissan Leaf. Through September, the Bolt has seen about 21,600 vehicles registered, Hyundai and Kia are in the 17,000-18,000-unit range, and VW approached 11,000 units. Including the tenth-place Leaf, no other EV has had registrations above 10,000 units over the first nine months of 2022. That said, there are caveats. Volkswagen's low volumes are affected by supply chain snarls and market allocations to more EV-friendly regions – issues Hyundai and Kia also face. However, VW's new ID.4 assembly line in Tennessee went live in October; the automaker said at the plant opening that it had 20,000 unfilled reservations and a plant capacity of 7,000 units per month. That should change the EV volume picture significantly. A look at the roughly 525,000 EVs registered over the first nine months of 2022 shows the EV market today remains in the hands of affluent buyers, who are spending more on their vehicles than ICE buyers. While logic dictates that further growth will require more EVs being offered in the $25,000 - $40,000 price range, the willingness of buyers to spend more today reflects an aspirational nature to the choice. Tesla's EV-only strategy gives it a retention advantage – as few EV owners have returned to ICE powertrains. But as new EVs arrive, loyalty will be tested. Currently, the Model Y has a 60.5% -brand loyalty and had nearly 74% of buyers come from outside the brand (the conquest rate) – tops in the industry. Who is Tesla conquesting from? Toyota, Honda, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.  Toyota and Honda are only beginning to get into the EV market, though have yet to enter the fray in earnest. The race to market Honda owners in particular are showing an interest in electric vehicles. Unfortunately for Honda, its first EV (a midsize SUV shared with GM) isn't expected until 2024, whereupon the second half of this decade sees a flurry of activity. That still presents the challenge of reconnecting with owners who have defected from the Honda brand. In its meteoric growth, Tesla has conquested Japanese icons: The top five Model Y conquests are the Lexus RX, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Honda Odyssey, and Honda Accord. Meanwhile, the top five Model 3 conquests are the Honda Civic, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. So even though the overall market has ditched sedans for SUVs, there remain some who prefer a sedan in electrified form. But it's not just Tesla winning over consumers of the big two Japanese brands. Early data of the 27,800 registrations of the Ford Mustang Mach-E through September, shows similar conquest patterns: The top Mach-E conquest model has been the Toyota RAV4 (regardless of powertrain), followed by the Honda CR-V and Jeep Wrangler. The Mach-E is also experiencing registrations at a lower MSRP range – 43% of registrations had an MSRP below $50,000 . For Ford, more than 63% of registrations from January through September 2022 were conquests from other brands. After the Mustang Mach-E, the next top EV is the Chevrolet Bolt (EUV and EV). The Bolt is likely to continue to gain ground, as it spent most of the fall and winter of 2021-22 in production hiatus as Chevrolet resolved a warranty issue, and then saw a price reduction soon after production re-started. With production back online, a more attractive price, and GM's plans to increase Bolt capacity in 2023, the vehicle has potential to keep growing. The Bolt also sees RAV4, CR-V and Prius as its top three conquest models. And while the Hyundai Ioniq5 is limited in its geographic distribution (and faces similar capacity and global demand issues as VW ID.4), S&P Global Mobility conquest data show most Ioniq5 buyers previously owned a Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 or Subaru Forester . Of the top 10 Ioniq5 conquests, only two are from the traditional Detroit Three brands, with the Chevrolet Bolt at seventh and Jeep Wrangler at tenth. Of course, the high conquest rates from Toyota and Honda come from the historical sales success of those models overall. The RAV4 is the best-selling non-pickup truck in the US, which means there are more RAV4 buyers to conquest. The Camry, Accord, and CR-V follow close behind. Along this path, however, these EVs are seeing little conquest of the F-Series or Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. In the S&P Global Mobility garage mate data, however, we see a strong F-Series representation. It shows up as a top garage mate for the Mustang Mach-E; the Bolt does see the Silverado as its top garage mate, the F-Series is next. F-Series is also the top garage mate for the Ioniq5, EV6 and ID.4. ""Though today's EV buyers are not giving up their pickups in favor of going electric, it also suggests that there is a pool of EV owners, who are also full-size pickup owners, being created,"" Brinley said. ""We know that EV owners tend to be loyal to EV propulsion. This intersection can provide support for EV pickup adoption."" An existing pool of current EV owners who also have pickups can be a benefit for the efforts in the full-size EV pick-up space, particularly for the Ford F-150 Lightning, Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, each of which is aimed at a traditional pick-up use case and owner. The Rivian S1T, GMC Hummer EV and Tesla Cybertruck each occupy a lifestyle pickup space, geared toward innovator buyers and statement-makers, and could be more likely to conquest buyers to the pickup segment as well as to an EV purchase. But for now, electric vehicles remain the provenance of sedans and small SUVs.
