(“Canoo”), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) from the ground up, and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (“HCAC”) (NASDAQ: HCAC), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in Canoo becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating company will be named Canoo Inc. and will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “CNOO.” Canoo is a high-growth EV company, distinguished by its experienced team with an emphasis on engineering expertise and achievement. Canoo has designed the world’s flattest modular “skateboard” platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo’s skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market’s first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard’s flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo’s EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or “top hats” that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard. Canoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, “Today marks an important milestone of Canoo’s effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world’s flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market.” Daniel Hennessy, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HCAC said, “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo on their mission to reinvent urban mobility with a greener, simpler and more affordable portfolio of EV solutions. Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings.” Led by Kranz, an automotive industry veteran with more than 30 years of executive experience at BMW, together with nearly 300 employees, the Canoo team has already shown its ability to deliver results by successfully designing, engineering and manufacturing its Beta vehicle in just 19 months and has completed more than 50 physical crash tests. Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets. This lifestyle vehicle – eponymously named the canoo – leverages the company’s low profile skateboard architecture to deliver the highest volume utilization across all classes of competitor vehicles currently on the market and has been purposefully developed for a subscription business model. In addition, Canoo has designed a commercial delivery B2B vehicle with expected availability in 2023 that directly capitalizes on Canoo’s core skateboard technology. Canoo’s delivery vehicle competes in a size segment that other competitors are currently not addressing and capitalizes on the need for a small, city- built, last-mile delivery solution. This high-efficiency platform maximizes cubic cargo volume and targets the fast growing last-mile delivery market. Canoo’s consumer go-to-market strategy capitalizes on changing consumer preferences to deliver a month-to-month, commitment-free, subscription-based business model. With a single monthly fee and no upfront payment, Canoo members enjoy the benefits of an all-inclusive experience that, in addition to your own canoo vehicle, includes maintenance, warranty, registration and access to insurance and vehicle charging. This go-to-market model is designed to deliver an affordable and simplified customer experience while also enhancing lifetime vehicle revenue and margin to shareholders.

Transaction Overview The business combination values Canoo at an implied $2.4 billion pro forma equity value, at the $10.00 per share price and assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The combined company will receive approximately $600 million of proceeds from an upsized fully committed common stock PIPE offering of over $300 million, along with the approximately $300 million cash held in trust assuming no redemptions of HCAC’s existing public stockholders. The boards of directors of both Canoo and HCAC have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to, among other things, the approval by HCAC stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. Additional information about the proposed transaction, including a copy of the merger agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by HCAC today with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov .

They make vans… can easily just do batteries built into the chassis etc? not doing steer by wire… with Amazon they might have financial help when needed… I personally hate luxury vehicles that dont need to be- like an $80,000 pick up truck etc… Lucid, I understand making luxury sedans for dueche bags… or Maybach-like SUVs eventually… Proterra working with Mercedes I think may be competition for Rivian- making work vans… There may be enough work van demand for all to do well? (Example- Canoo in foreign markets.) So I guess the competition with Rivian/Canoo comes down to the consumer vehicles? seems like a giant versus an unknown… I’m excited to see Canoo rise on the scene and move in on Rivian’s projected turf, with better products and manufacturing intelligence. Hopefully it’s not just a - who has more money, game. Canoo seems to have awesome engineering. Not familiar with Rivian’s tech, from a glance seems pretty bland?

July 12, 2022 8 Min. Read Innovation Copy link to clipboard BENTONVILLE, Ark., July 12, 2022 — Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has signed a definitive agreement with Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV), with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. The vehicles will be used to deliver online orders in a sustainable way which will also contribute to Walmart’s goal to achieve zero-emissions by 2040. While the LDV is expected to begin hitting the road in 2023, the companies plan to kick off advanced deliveries to refine and finalize vehicle configuration in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the coming weeks. The LDV: Engineered for sustainable last mile deliveries with improved driver ergonomics and safety Canoo’s fully electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) is an all-American commercial EV optimized for sustainable last mile delivery use cases. As with all Canoo vehicles, the LDV is built on a proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates the motors, battery module and other critical driving components. The LDV has a last mile delivery optimized cabin and customized cargo space. Canoo is utilizing true steer by wire technology, reducing moving parts and cabin intrusion, resulting in more usable interior space, better driver ergonomics and the addition of a panoramic window to improve road visibility. The LDV is engineered for high frequency stop-and-go deliveries and speedy vehicle to door drop-off, including grocery and food/meal delivery. Its customized interior is designed for small package delivery, at competitive per stop economics. The modular design and 120 cubic feet cargo volume are adaptable to evolve with customer needs which contributes to a decreasing per unit investment over time. “We are proud to have been selected by Walmart, one of the most sophisticated buyers in the world, to provide our high-tech, all-electric, American made Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle to add to their impressive logistics capabilities. Our LDV has the turning radius of a small passenger vehicle on a parking friendly, compact footprint, yet the payload and cargo space of a commercial delivery vehicle. This is the winning algorithm to seriously compete in the last mile delivery race, globally,” said Tony Aquila, investor, chairman and CEO of Canoo. “Walmart’s massive store footprint provides a strategic advantage in today’s growing ‘Need it now’ mindset and an unmatched opportunity for growing EV demand, especially at today’s gas prices.” Expanding Walmart’s last mile delivery fleet Canoo’s electric vehicles will be driven by Walmart associates and used to deliver online orders, from groceries to general merchandise, as well as the potential to be used for Walmart GoLocal, the retailer’s delivery-as-a-service business. “We’re thrilled to continue diversifying our last mile delivery fleet with Canoo’s unique and sustainably focused all-electric technology which will provide our associates with safe, ergonomic delivery vehicles,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation and automation, Walmart U.S. “Today, the closest Walmart to customers is right in their pockets – it’s the Walmart app. By continuing to expand our last mile delivery fleet in a sustainable way, we’re able to provide customers and Walmart+ members with even more access to same-day deliveries while keeping costs low.” In addition to dedicated fulfillment centers, Walmart uses 3,800 of its stores, which are located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, to fulfill online orders. The retailer does this using a combination of Walmart associates, independent contractors driving on the Spark Driver Network, third-party delivery service providers, and in some locations, autonomous vehicles and drones, to make deliveries. Through their expansive last mile delivery network, Walmart can reach 80% of the U.S. population with same-day delivery on a growing assortment of items. Collaborating close to home Canoo’s agreement with Walmart builds on the company’s existing commitments in the state of Arkansas. Last year Canoo announced it had selected Bentonville, Arkansas, as its headquarters and Pryor, Oklahoma, as the site for its U.S. manufacturing, further establishing an EV ecosystem in the heartland to create thousands of technology and manufacturing jobs in the surrounding communities. “We’re encouraged that by being located in close proximity to the Canoo headquarters, we have the advantage to collaborate and innovate in real-time as well as the opportunity to aid in the creation of manufacturing and technology jobs here in our home state of Arkansas,” added Guggina. Canoo anticipates starting production of the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles beginning in Q4, 2022. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

Aug 15, 2023 at 11:18AM Key Points Canoo reported a smaller-than-expected loss for Q2 2023. The company is still burning cash at a frightful rate -- but still finding people to lend it money. For Lucid and Rivian, that could be a problem. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOEV Canoo Market Cap $157M Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-3.16%) -$0.00 Current Price $0.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More The longer Canoo stays alive, the worse it will be for everyone who competes with it. What happened Tuesday's looking like a lousy day to be invested in electric vehicle (EV) stocks , as shares of EV manufacturer Canoo ( GOEV -3.16% ) tumbled after the company reported another sizable loss, and better-established EV start-ups Rivian Automotive ( RIVN -0.31% ) and Lucid Group ( LCID 2.20% ) follow them down. As of 10:30 a.m. ET, Canoo stock is sinking 6%, tied with Lucid's 6% loss, and Rivian stock is doing only a little bit better -- down 4.7%. So what Canoo crowed, at the top of its earnings release, that it has finally ""entered the revenue and income generation phase"" of its business as contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and NASA begin filtering onto the top line. And yet as of today there's still no sign of them. Instead, Canoo reported zero revenue for the quarter (just like last year's Q2). On the plus side, while the company didn't actually generate any income either, its loss for Q2 2023 was only $0.14 per share -- better than analysts' forecast $0.19-per-share loss. Canoo also noted that it ended the quarter with $5 million in cash -- but would have ended with $61.2 million if it had completed some stock and debt sales, accomplished later, within the quarter. Now what The problem with this for Canoo is that, according to Canoo's cash flow statement , the company is still burning through cash at a rate well in excess of $80 million per quarter -- and if that keeps happening, then I'm afraid even $61.2 million in cash isn't going to cut it, and this company is going to have to sell even more stock, and take on even more debt, in order to remain afloat. The problem with this for Rivian and Lucid, meanwhile, is that Canoo still seems to be able to access financing to keep itself afloat. And that means that Canoo is still sticking around to offer electric vehicles to shoppers who might otherwise be buying Rivians and Lucids. And that could be a real problem for these similarly unprofitable rival EV makers. Just last week, HotCars.com ran a glowing profile of Canoo's new electric pickup truck, and indeed, its entire lineup of ""affordable electric vehicles for regular customers,"" that contrasts starkly with Lucid's offering of an $82,000 Air luxury electric sedan, for example, or Rivian's $80,000 electric pickup truck. At the $39,950 list price that HotCars describes, Canoo's electric lifestyle vehicle costs literally half of what the competition is charging, and Canoo's new electric pickup is expected to be similarly affordable. Sure, you could point out that Canoo's truck won't be out for another couple of years, while Rivian and Lucid are selling EVs already today, but if Canoo can keep itself solvent long enough, the risk is that buyers will decide it's still worth the wait.

$2.4 billion News provided by Canoo 18 Aug, 2020, 07:00 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X LOS ANGELES , Aug. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Holdings Ltd. (""Canoo""), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) from the ground up, and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (""HCAC"") (NASDAQ: HCAC ), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in Canoo becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating company will be named Canoo Inc. and will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ""CNOO."" Continue Reading Canoo is a high-growth EV company, distinguished by its experienced team with an emphasis on engineering expertise and achievement. Canoo has designed the world's flattest modular ""skateboard"" platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo's skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market's first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard's flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo's EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or ""top hats"" that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard. Canoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, ""Today marks an important milestone of Canoo's effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world's flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market."" Daniel Hennessy, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HCAC said, ""We are thrilled to partner with Canoo on their mission to reinvent urban mobility with a greener, simpler and more affordable portfolio of EV solutions. Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings."" Led by Kranz, an automotive industry veteran with more than 30 years of executive experience at BMW, together with nearly 300 employees, the Canoo team has already shown its ability to deliver results by successfully designing, engineering and manufacturing its Beta vehicle in just 19 months and has completed more than 50 physical crash tests. Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets. This lifestyle vehicle – eponymously named the canoo – leverages the company's low profile skateboard architecture to deliver the highest volume utilization across all classes of competitor vehicles currently on the market and has been purposefully developed for a subscription business model. In addition, Canoo has designed a commercial delivery B2B vehicle with expected availability in 2023 that directly capitalizes on Canoo's core skateboard technology. Canoo's delivery vehicle competes in a size segment that other competitors are currently not addressing and capitalizes on the need for a small, city-built, last-mile delivery solution. This high-efficiency platform maximizes cubic cargo volume and targets the fast growing last-mile delivery market. Canoo's consumer go-to-market strategy capitalizes on changing consumer preferences to deliver a month-to-month, commitment-free, subscription-based business model. With a single monthly fee and no upfront payment, Canoo members enjoy the benefits of an all-inclusive experience that, in addition to your own canoo vehicle, includes maintenance, warranty, registration and access to insurance and vehicle charging. This go-to-market model is designed to deliver an affordable and simplified customer experience while also enhancing lifetime vehicle revenue and margin to shareholders.

The vans are expected to go into service in 2023. Shares of Canoo gained more than 50% following the news. In this article GOEV GOEV Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Walmart to Purchase 4,500 Canoo Electric Delivery Vehicles to be Used for Last Mile Deliveries in Support of Its Growing eCommerce Business Courtesy: Canoo | Walmart Electric vehicle startup Canoo said Tuesday Walmart has agreed to buy at least 4,500 of its upcoming electric delivery vans, in a significant win for the embattled vehicle maker. Shares of Canoo gained more than 50% following the news. Walmart has signed a ""definitive agreement"" to purchase at least 4,500, and possibly as many as 10,000, of its all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles, a small electric van designed for local delivery service, Canoo said. Walmart is leaning on its thousands of stores to deliver online purchases quickly and at a lower costs — and compete with Amazon , an online rival known for its speed. It has rolled out and expanded e-commerce services, including InHome, which delivers groceries directly to customers' fridges and Express Delivery, which drops purchases at shoppers' doors in two hours or less. Unlimited home delivery of groceries is also a key perk of Walmart+, an annual membership service that the big-box retailer wants to grow. But to expand those services, it needs more delivery vans. InHome is powered by an all-electric fleet. Canoo marks the third major deal signed by Walmart for electric vans. Early this year, Walmart reserved 5,000 electric vans from General Motors subsidiary BrightDrop . It also bought 1,100 electric vans from Ford E-Transit, some of which it is already operating. The big-box retailer plans to use electric vans from all three companies for InHome and other local deliveries. It intends to increase the availability of InHome from 6 million to 30 million households by the end of this year, as it adds major metros like Los Angeles and Chicago. The shift also comes at a time when fuel is weighing on Walmart's profitability and making online deliveries more expensive. The company said last week in a memo that it would charge some suppliers new fees to transport goods to its warehouses and stores. Canoo's vans will be built at its Oklahoma factory and are expected to begin going into service next year. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Canoo is one of several U.S.-based electric vehicle startups to have gone public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. The company's shares briefly surged to over $20 after its stock market debut in late 2020 , but have slid since co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz departed last year . As of Tuesday's close the stock was trading at $3.63 per share. — Reuters contributed to this report. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the vans will be built in Canoo's factory in Oklahoma.
