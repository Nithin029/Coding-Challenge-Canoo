The new facility will expand Canoo’s manufacturing and employment footprint in the region. Once ramped, the facility will be capable of approximately 3200 MWhs of battery module manufacturing capacity. “We are accelerating our hiring plans in Pryor with the establishment of our EV Battery Module Manufacturing Facility, which will produce our proprietary battery modules, energy management system and thermal control technology for our MPP platform” said Tony Aquila, Chairman and CEO at Canoo. “This is the first building block for Canoo’s production ramp strategy, with more news coming very soon. The location has been strategically selected due to its proximity to our battery cell partner Panasonic and our future Mega-Micro factory. In addition, we will be the first EV company to produce our battery modules with Hydro-Power from the Grand River Dam Authority. We will work closely with and hire within the surrounding communities to create an EV Ecosystem in the region.” Canoo previously announced Panasonic as its battery cell provider. The company will begin renovations on its 100K sq.ft building located on a 10-acre campus in Q4, 2022 in preparation for delivery of secured manufacturing equipment in Q1, 2023. This location will produce proprietary battery modules on high-capacity assembly lines with state-of-the-art automated machinery. Canoo has refined and validated its battery module manufacturing over recent months and is awaiting delivery of machinery at the new facility. The battery campus will be powered by hydroelectricity from Grand River Dam Authority. Canoo’s battery campus will implement workforce training programs in partnership with the Cherokee Nation, MidAmerica and other local training partners with a goal to provide high paying light blue collar jobs to the local community. “We are very excited about Canoo accelerating their activities in Pryor with this Battery Module Manufacturing Facility as they ramp up production and ultimately prepare the site for their previously announced MegaMicro Factory” said Dave Stewart, CEO of MAIP. ""This is a very encouraging signal to the community and the state of Oklahoma as we continue to attract high-technology companies and jobs.” The Battery Facility will be in proximity to Canoo’s MegaMicro Factory, a 400-acre campus at MidAmerica Industrial Park, a 9,000-acre industrial complex strategically located near some of the nation’s most highly traveled thoroughfares. When built, the MegaMicro Factory will include a full commercialization facility with a paint, body shop and general assembly plant. It will be a significant investment in the state and will employ more than 2,000 when fully operational. About Canoo Canoo’s mission is to bring EVs to Everyone.

A lot of full size pick-up capability packed in a compact EV foot-print. Couple of months ago, someone was at the right place at the right time and snapped photos of a prototype sport coupe of theirs also. There was a link in the old forum. I’m sticking with the Aptera for my primary / commuter vehicle though. joshua-rosen Member September 29, 2021 at 12:43 pm Looks like a great taxi, 250 miles of range is probably fine for a taxi. jonah-jorgenson Member April 6, 2022 at 12:13 pm Extended spring break over for me with submission of my thesis and on the way from cold Boston to Sunny Titusville FL. In an effort to get plugged back into work talking with my Artemis Project colleagues, learned that a EV start up called Canoo supplanted Tesla for a NASA contract to transport Artemis Astronauts to the launch pad. Not lucrative from the financial standpoint but great publicity both for Canoo and Nasa (Select an electric startup to support a space mission) Canoo is a startup competitor for Aptera for 2023. A bit of a sleeper. I have a cousin that has one reserved for his family (Married with three children) Steering is “Fly by wire” so easy to do right had drive.

Leaver Member April 8, 2022 at 1:43 pm I have two Canoos reserved… the pick up and the van. They are a long shot for sure, but I love their concept and fingers crossed that they make it to production. john-malcom Member May 19, 2022 at 10:20 am I technically track Canoo financials for an EV manufacturer who is releasing a new EV. They consider Canoo as a potential competitor to a soon to be released electric SUV. Canoo, in their recent investor relations report said, “As of the date of this announcement, we are reporting that there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.” Canoo Merged with a SPAC In August 2020 and had a market cap of 2.4 billion. Now they are nearly out of money. The calculated probability of Canoo going bankrupt (Probability Of Bankruptcy = Normalized Z-Score) has moved from 24% a few days ago to 77% today. The current management kicked out the founders thinking they could do a better job. Sound familiar? If you don’t think Aptera Management walks on water, review what they have done and are doing with a few million This reply was modified 1 year, 9 months ago by John Malcom . This reply was modified 1 year, 3 months ago by Gabriel Kemeny . jesthorbjorn Member May 19, 2022 at 11:21 am I’ve been pulling for Canoo to succeed also but..um…yeah. The current differences between the two start-ups have been pretty stark so far. Your point about the similarity to Aptera part one is ironic. The ultimate bankruptcy for Canoo has already been predicted by some. joshua-rosen Member May 19, 2022 at 12:11 pm I’m of the opinion that the absolute worst thing for a startup is to have too much money which is Canoo’s situation (they’ve raised $600M). It’s much better to have too little which is Aptera’s situation. Startups need to make quick decisions and to focus on fundamentals, that’s what watching every penny forces you to do. It’s also important to have a small team of high quality people, that’s much more effective than having a giant team of average people. Giant teams can’t optimize, the classic treatise on this is Mythical Man Month. Underfunded companies are forced to have a small tight team. Having too much money removes the discipline necessary to succeed, that seems to be Canoo’s situation. John, you’ve been watching them, how have they managed to blow through $600M so quickly? That’s a huge cash bonfire. john-malcom Member May 19, 2022 at 5:02 pm That is a great question! Of course all is conjecture since the finance/accounting data is not available even though the company is public. The most popular explanation, again without any supportive data, is that Canoo was counting on funding and other support from the Hyundai partnership and over committed to building the US production facility, hire surge staffing in preparation for the expected work, and then when the partnership fell through had more committed than was prudent. The second part of that is that Canoo had arranged and expected to have initial production done in Europe while the OK production facility was being built out planning on early production revenue. That arrangement failed as well so then they had to acquire a short term production facility in AK and outfit it for early production to start getting operational revenue. An unanticipated and unplanned expense. Add that to the move into other facilities in AK (Probably expecting lower operating costs) and their financial over extension caught up with them. Other thoughts are crying wolf to get current investors to ante up more money so they don’t loose what they have already invested this close to production. The Canoo schedule is almost identical to Apteras. the least popular but still alive is that they became heady with all of the cash they got from their SPAC and didn’t pay attention to finical controls. Another thought is that they surreptitiously want to do a Chapter 11, restructure their debt, and continue to operate. And almost an infinite number of others!!😜 much like American politics. Does make you appreciate the management of Aptera a lot more. This reply was modified 1 year, 9 months ago by John Malcom . Reason: add content and corrected grammar This reply was modified 1 year, 3 months ago by Gabriel Kemeny . joshua-rosen Member May 19, 2022 at 6:05 pm Thanks, that was an informative answer. Unfortunately the market is tanking and when that happens investors would rather lose it all rather part with any new money. In 2009 I had a customer that had really important supercomputer technology. They ran out of cash and they were forced into liquidation. Intel had put $40M into them but they weren’t willing to spend a penny at that moment. Huawei swooped in and bought their assets for $2M and hired their team, these were assets that had taken $80M to develop. CFIUS (the US government committee on foreign investment in the US) got wind of it and made them disgorge the IP, not that it mattered because it had probably all been transferred to China within minutes of Huawei’s purchase. Intel lost their $40M investment rather then spend the lousy $2M it would have taken to bring it in house, but it was 2009 and they weren’t spending money, if they had bought the assets it would be in their cloud products today. This reply was modified 1 year, 9 months ago by Joshua Rosen . john-malcom Member May 19, 2022 at 6:21 pm That is a discouraging story but I suspect not uncommon and typical of the way the financial people think. Results in lost opportunities and advantage to the competitors joshua-rosen Member May 20, 2022 at 7:27 am It’s also illustrative of how the Chinese handle situations like this. While no one in the US was willing to step up Huawei pounced. The same thing happened to the Aptera Rev 1, the assets were bought by a Chinese company, that didn’t work out for them but the battery maker A123, which had it’s assets bought by Wanxiang, is still around and doing well. One final thing about the Huawei story. Huawei tried to do an end run around our laws. Acquisitions by a foreign company have to be approved by CFIUS. Rather than apply for permission to buy the company Huawei bought the IP and hired the engineers without buying the company itself. CFIUS found out and made them give away the IP, in CFIUS’s eyes if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it’s a duck i.e. they had bought the company without playing by the foreign acquisition rules. daniel-chin Member May 19, 2022 at 12:16 pm It’s not clear that Aptera will IPO or take the SPAC route. In one of “Aptera Owners Club” videos of the SEC filing, I recall seeing the CFO’s potential bonus options; one of them included getting a valuation of 1-2B or completing a SPAC transaction.

Shawgrin Member May 19, 2022 at 1:29 pm I have been following Canoo for awhile and had been planning on buying one for my wife. When I saw the original founders leaving, I cancelled my purchase, feeling that (not being a financial specialist) something fell apart in the well being of the company. I was nearly as jazzed up for the Canoo as I am for the Aptera. Canoo has nearly 40 Delta vehicles and some great contracts that may go unfilled. I dearly hope that we do see Apteras on the road with thousands of people driving them.

Completely different use cases than Aptera but still impressively innovative. jesthorbjorn Member December 9, 2022 at 3:06 pm Wow, it is a pain in the ass to get hyperlinks to work on this website!😒 jonah-jorgenson Member December 10, 2022 at 7:29 am Canoo is a legitimate competitor to Aptera as it is a weekly popular form factor for a large proportion of the market. I have an uncle that has a Canoo reservation. He is impressed with the “Drive by wire” tech, the seating capacity (He has a large and growing family), and the price in the ’30s. Not so impressed with the range, but rationalizes it with the growing number of charging stations. He will be able to charge for nothing at home as he has a robust, full-home backup solar system. Canoo recently avoided the same issue facing Aptera, insufficient funds to proceed with production. Saved by Walmart order and support. Log In to Reply Log in or register to reply.

The company has been dangerously close to insolvency for the past year, and its cash burn remains high. Despite this, the federal government has kept doing business with the startup, saving it from certain doom. Analysis of the financial situation of Canoo This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial situation of Canoo as well as the efforts that the company is making to collaborate with the federal government. We will look into the company’s history, as well as the ongoing initiatives and challenges it faces in its pursuit to become an industry powerhouse in electric vehicles. Former BMW executives, including Stefan Krause, who left the failing EV startup Faraday Future, founded Canoo in late 2017. Company founders originally called it Evelozcity and imagined a subscription-based business model in which they produced electric vans and trucks for people who enjoy outdoor activities. Canoo’s original goals were the same as those of other EV start-ups at the time, which all hoped to one day replace Tesla. However, financial difficulties have made it difficult for the company to establish itself in the industry. The government partnership is secured Canoo may have been on the verge of collapse if not for the federal government partnerships it has secured . Three crew transport vehicles manufactured by the company have been delivered to NASA for use in the upcoming Artemis mission to the Moon . Transportation for astronauts on the Artemis lunar mission will begin next year with the arrival of these vehicles at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The United States Army has used Canoo EVs for “analysis and demonstration.” The company’s Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) is currently being evaluated by the Army to determine if further military orders will be placed. The LTV is based on the same chassis as Canoo’s 2021 electric pickup truck prototype, which resembles a Duplo toy. Canoo “expanded” its collaboration with the Defense Department’s Innovation Unit this week to develop high-capacity battery packs for use in military vehicles as well as energy-dense batteries for use by the United States Navy. The state of Canoo’s finances has been preoccupying for some time. The business has been dangerously close to insolvency for the past year due to persistently high cash burn. With share prices below $1 , delisting from the stock exchange is a real possibility. Despite the company’s ongoing financial struggles, the federal government has continued to conduct business with the company. The outlook for Canoo’s finances is gloomy, and it is unclear whether NASA or the Defense Department is concerned about how a Chapter 11 filing would affect the company’s ongoing government projects. However, the outlook is not good. If Canoo’s current financial situation does not improve, the company may never become the next Tesla. The business is currently working on producing many electric vehicles (EVs), including the Canoo Pickup Truck and the MPDV (multi-purpose delivery van). In 2019, Canoo made its first public appearance with a vehicle resembling a microbus, and this toy-like truck demonstrated how far the company is willing to take the design. Canoo will need to raise more capital to continue operations Canoo will need to raise more capital to continue operations , and it will also need to solidify its position as a market leader in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Rivian, another upstart that has had its share of problems but is finally starting to see some delivery success, provides stiff competition for the company. In conclusion, Canoo may be treading water, but the company has been saved by its collaborations with the government. Despite having financial difficulties, the company has secured contracts with NASA, the US Army, and the Defense Department’s Innovation Unit. Canoo’s future is unclear, but the company has government partnerships that give investors reason to believe it could become a significant player in the EV industry.

Canoo has delivered crew transport vehicles to NASA for the upcoming Artemis mission to the Moon. The United States Army has also used Canoo EVs for analysis and demonstration. Q: What vehicles is Canoo developing? A: Canoo is developing electric vehicles (EVs) such as the MPDV (multi-purpose delivery van) and the Canoo Pickup Truck. The company’s microbus-style vehicle debuted in 2019. Q: What are Canoo’s prospects for the future?

July 12, 2022 8 Min. Read Innovation Copy link to clipboard BENTONVILLE, Ark., July 12, 2022 — Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has signed a definitive agreement with Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, to purchase 4,500 all-electric delivery vehicles, beginning with the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV), with the option to purchase up to 10,000 units. The vehicles will be used to deliver online orders in a sustainable way which will also contribute to Walmart’s goal to achieve zero-emissions by 2040. While the LDV is expected to begin hitting the road in 2023, the companies plan to kick off advanced deliveries to refine and finalize vehicle configuration in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the coming weeks. The LDV: Engineered for sustainable last mile deliveries with improved driver ergonomics and safety Canoo’s fully electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle (LDV) is an all-American commercial EV optimized for sustainable last mile delivery use cases. As with all Canoo vehicles, the LDV is built on a proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates the motors, battery module and other critical driving components. The LDV has a last mile delivery optimized cabin and customized cargo space. Canoo is utilizing true steer by wire technology, reducing moving parts and cabin intrusion, resulting in more usable interior space, better driver ergonomics and the addition of a panoramic window to improve road visibility. The LDV is engineered for high frequency stop-and-go deliveries and speedy vehicle to door drop-off, including grocery and food/meal delivery. Its customized interior is designed for small package delivery, at competitive per stop economics. The modular design and 120 cubic feet cargo volume are adaptable to evolve with customer needs which contributes to a decreasing per unit investment over time. “We are proud to have been selected by Walmart, one of the most sophisticated buyers in the world, to provide our high-tech, all-electric, American made Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle to add to their impressive logistics capabilities. Our LDV has the turning radius of a small passenger vehicle on a parking friendly, compact footprint, yet the payload and cargo space of a commercial delivery vehicle. This is the winning algorithm to seriously compete in the last mile delivery race, globally,” said Tony Aquila, investor, chairman and CEO of Canoo. “Walmart’s massive store footprint provides a strategic advantage in today’s growing ‘Need it now’ mindset and an unmatched opportunity for growing EV demand, especially at today’s gas prices.” Expanding Walmart’s last mile delivery fleet Canoo’s electric vehicles will be driven by Walmart associates and used to deliver online orders, from groceries to general merchandise, as well as the potential to be used for Walmart GoLocal, the retailer’s delivery-as-a-service business. “We’re thrilled to continue diversifying our last mile delivery fleet with Canoo’s unique and sustainably focused all-electric technology which will provide our associates with safe, ergonomic delivery vehicles,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation and automation, Walmart U.S. “Today, the closest Walmart to customers is right in their pockets – it’s the Walmart app. By continuing to expand our last mile delivery fleet in a sustainable way, we’re able to provide customers and Walmart+ members with even more access to same-day deliveries while keeping costs low.” In addition to dedicated fulfillment centers, Walmart uses 3,800 of its stores, which are located within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, to fulfill online orders. The retailer does this using a combination of Walmart associates, independent contractors driving on the Spark Driver Network, third-party delivery service providers, and in some locations, autonomous vehicles and drones, to make deliveries. Through their expansive last mile delivery network, Walmart can reach 80% of the U.S. population with same-day delivery on a growing assortment of items. Collaborating close to home Canoo’s agreement with Walmart builds on the company’s existing commitments in the state of Arkansas. Last year Canoo announced it had selected Bentonville, Arkansas, as its headquarters and Pryor, Oklahoma, as the site for its U.S. manufacturing, further establishing an EV ecosystem in the heartland to create thousands of technology and manufacturing jobs in the surrounding communities. “We’re encouraged that by being located in close proximity to the Canoo headquarters, we have the advantage to collaborate and innovate in real-time as well as the opportunity to aid in the creation of manufacturing and technology jobs here in our home state of Arkansas,” added Guggina. Canoo anticipates starting production of the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles beginning in Q4, 2022. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

Canoo trades under the ticker $GOEV. Members Online • lifesabeach2000 ADMIN MOD Thoughts on Rivian as competition? Competitors what is everyone’s feelings about Rivian being competition with Canoo? They make vans… can easily just do batteries built into the chassis etc? not doing steer by wire… with Amazon they might have financial help when needed… I personally hate luxury vehicles that dont need to be- like an $80,000 pick up truck etc… Lucid, I understand making luxury sedans for dueche bags… or Maybach-like SUVs eventually… Proterra working with Mercedes I think may be competition for Rivian- making work vans… There may be enough work van demand for all to do well? (Example- Canoo in foreign markets.) So I guess the competition with Rivian/Canoo comes down to the consumer vehicles? seems like a giant versus an unknown… I’m excited to see Canoo rise on the scene and move in on Rivian’s projected turf, with better products and manufacturing intelligence. Hopefully it’s not just a - who has more money, game. Canoo seems to have awesome engineering. Not familiar with Rivian’s tech, from a glance seems pretty bland?

Lucid Group ( LCID ): Falling reservation numbers signal Lucid is struggling to compete with established rivals. Mullen Automotive ( MULN ): By the time the Mullen Five hits the streets, the premium EV market could be a crowded field. Continue reading for the complete list of EV stocks to sell! Source: Shutterstock Although electric vehicle stocks have become far less hot during this bear market, the pivot towards vehicle electrification keeps moving forward. Even so, that doesn’t mean every EV stock is a buy. In fact, there are plenty of names one should consider EV stocks to sell. Why? The overall trend may be favorable, but in the case of several publicly-traded EV makers, there’s a headwind that far outweighs this tailwind: rising competition. Since the start of the year, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has shored up its leading position in the global EV market, by slashing vehicle prices . In addition, incumbent automakers around the world are moving into EVs in a big way. Tesla may be able to stay ahead, but these “old school,” suddenly “new school” competitors could leave plenty of EV upstarts in the dust. With rising competition potentially limiting their chances of reaching big success, consider it best to steer clear of these seven EV stocks to sell. GOEV Canoo $0.59 LCID Lucid Group $8.19 MULN Mullen Automotive $0.11 NIO Nio $9.07 RIDE Lordstown Motors $0.64 RIVN Rivian Automotive $13.62 XPEV Xpeng $9.62 Canoo (GOEV) Source: Shutterstock As a maker of EVs primarily for the commercial market, at first Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV ) may seem more immune to competition compared to the EV makers focused on the passenger market. However, while the company may be having little trouble securing orders (given its more than $2 billion backlog ) for now, competition could start having an impact, as “old school” automakers move into the electrified commercial van market. That said, the biggest concern with GOEV stock continues to be this early-stage EV company’s high levels of cash burn. In order to stay in business, and to finance its expansion, Canoo has depended on dilutive capital raises. The most recent one (raising $52.5 million ) occurred in Feb. Canoo may have a better shot of success than many of the other names listed below, yet with high dilution, this may not translate into big gains for investors. Lucid Group (LCID) Source: Shutterstock Two years ago, Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID ) may have been successfully selling itself to investors as a “Tesla killer” in the making, but as I argued recently, this EV maker has since lost its “young gun” reputation . With underwhelming production and delivery numbers, the company has fallen from top contender to also-ran, in the EV pecking order. With all of this competition, atop the market’s more cautious view on EV stocks, it’s not surprising that LCID stock has fallen by more than 68% in the past year. Worse yet, competition keeps standing in its way. Lucid’s reservation numbers keep dropping . This may be a sign that affluent EV buyers are taking a pass on the Lucid Air luxury sedan, opting instead for comparable offerings from Tesla, as well as from established automakers. Add in its own big dilution risk, and LCID is clearly one of the EV stocks to sell. Mullen Automotive (MULN) Source: Shutterstock Trading for well below $1 per share, the market has obviously made up its mind about Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN ). Perceived positives such as the company’s controversial battery claims at one point wowed investors. But after a year of zero sales, heavy losses, and high levels of shareholder dilution , few are buying into the MULN stock story anymore. Yes, Mullen has reached the production stage , and is securing orders for its vehicles. However, Mullen needs cash to scale up production of its existing and planned offerings, including its Mullen Five crossover model for the premium passenger EV market. Raising this capital will result in additional heavy dilution. With regards to competitive risks, by the time it starts rolling Mullen Fives off the assembly line, the premium EV market will be a crowded field. By then, several of the passenger EV upstarts will be much further ahead. Nio (NIO) Source: Shutterstock Slowing growth has been a key reason why Nio (NYSE: NIO ) shares have underperformed over the past twelve months. In early 2022, the China-based EV maker’s management was touting a big production ramp-up at the end of last year. Yet due to the impact of China’s Covid lockdowns on the country’s supply chain, this big ramp-up failed to arrive. Thus far this year, growth challenges have persisted, placing more pressure on NIO stock. The end of China’s EV subsidies have likely played a role, but the impact of Tesla’s price cuts has also been a big factor. Nio’s management is still arguing that it can sell 250,000 vehicles this year. That’s more than double last year’s figure. However,  competition is likely to make achieving this sales goal easier-said-than-done. NIO could experience yet another big plunge, if actual results fall short, making this another of the EV stocks to sell. Lordstown Motors (RIDE) Source: Shutterstock As I put it recently, Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ: RIDE ) has clearly reached the end of the road . One of the first electric truck startups to go public, this EV stock once traded for more than $30 per share, as the market at the time believed it has a shot of becoming a major name in this space. Today, you can buy RIDE stock for just 67 cents per share, but even at a nearly 98% discount to its all-time closing high , it’s far from a bargain. Pausing production/deliveries in February , due to quality issues, Lordstown’s management is searching for a strategic partner, in order to enter the mass-production stage for its Endurance electric pickup truck. The problem? Based on the fact that basically every major pickup manufacturer has its own EV pickup on the road or in the works, the chances Lordstown secures a partner appear to be slim-to-none. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Source: Shutterstock Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN ), in contrast to Lordstown, is an electric truck maker that has made major progress getting towards the mass production stage. However, that doesn’t mean it is being incorrectly placed on this list of EV stocks to sell. In recent weeks, investors have bid down RIVN stock. Its progress notwithstanding, the company’s growth has fallen short of expectations. Cash burn has also been significant , raising concerns about (you guessed it) future dilution from likely equity raises down the road. That’s not all. The impact of competition could affect Rivian’s future performance, and put more pressure on RIVN’s stock price. Why? Ford (NYSE: F ), which before selling its stake was a large backer of Rivian, is now outselling it, based on recent F-150 Lightning sales numbers . Through tactics such as vehicle price cuts, it may not take much for Ford to leave Rivian completely in the dust. Xpeng (XPEV) Source: Shutterstock Tesla’s China vehicle price cuts have hurt Nio, yet they’ve had a greater impact on Xpeng (NYSE: XPEV ), another major Chinese EV maker. In response to lower Tesla prices, and disappointing 2022, Xpeng implemented its own vehicle price cuts. While this led to disappointing outlook for the first quarter of 2023 , the company’s management believes that these price cuts, plus the planned launch of new vehicle models, will result in a growth resurgence. XPEV stock has rallied in recent weeks. This suggests the market is also bullish that a comeback is in store. But while Xpeng may have a game plan, this may not be enough to spark a sales rebound. According to a Chinese EV industry expert, Tesla has lowered its prices in China enough to make them affordable for mass market EV buyers in China. This unexpected mass market competition could quell an Xpeng comeback.

competitors of canoo in EV industry,https://www.kavout.com/blog/analyst-perspectives-on-canoo-nasdaqgoev-an-investment-evaluation/,Analyst Perspectives on Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV): An Investment ...,"Analyst Perspectives on Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV): An Investment Evaluation - Kavout Chat Market Movers Stock Movers ETF Movers Stocks S&P 500 Nasdaq 100 Dow Jones Russell 1000 Sector & Industry Internationnal Listings Popular Stocks ETF Alternatives Bitcoin Bond Commodity Currency Energy Equity Financials Global Macro Gold Healthcare High Dividend Yield Information Technology Large Cap Mid Cap Multi-Asset Real Estate Small Cap Utilities Volatility Blog Company Portfolio Toolbox Signal DB About Us Sign In Select Page Analyst Perspectives on Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV): An Investment Evaluation Dec 27, 2023 | Stock Analysis Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), a company within the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has been under the scrutiny of analysts and investors alike. In recent times, the stock has experienced significant volatility, prompting a diverse range of opinions regarding its investment potential. This report aims to dissect the prevailing analyst views on Canoo and assess whether it constitutes a good buy, based on the information provided and within the context of the current market environment. Analyst Ratings and Price Targets As of the latest available data, Canoo has been the subject of analysis by HC Wainwright and others, with a consensus price target of $2.02, which suggests a substantial upside of 750.91% from its recent trading price. This optimistic forecast is predicated on the assumption of Canoo’s potential to capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and overcome its current challenges. However, the stock’s performance has not been without its setbacks. A report from The Motley Fool highlights that Canoo’s stock price has plummeted by a staggering 99% ( Yahoo Finance ). This decline raises concerns about the company’s viability and the sustainability of its business model. Despite this, there are signals that Canoo is ramping up production and preparing to make significant deliveries, which could be a turning point for the company’s financial health and stock performance. Market Sentiment and Competitive Landscape The EV market has been characterized by heightened enthusiasm, followed by a sobering correction as the initial hype fades. Canoo, like many of its peers, has not been immune to these fluctuations. The company’s stock has suffered as a result, and market sentiment appears to be cautious. Nonetheless, the EV sector remains a high-growth area, and companies that can navigate the production and delivery challenges effectively may be well-positioned to reap long-term rewards. In comparison to its competitors, Canoo’s current market valuation may reflect a disconnect between its intrinsic value and market price. If Canoo can execute its business plan successfully, it could emerge as a competitive player in the EV space, thus justifying the optimistic price targets set by analysts. Financial Overview and Future Potential Canoo’s third-quarter print was promising, indicating that the company may be on the cusp of a turnaround. A positive financial performance and the potential for future growth have led to a ‘Buy’ rating recommendation by some analysts. This perspective is supported by the company’s strategic moves to increase production capacity and readiness to deliver vehicles in large numbers. It is important to note, however, that investing in Canoo carries significant risk. The company’s stock has already experienced a dramatic decline, and while this could present a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors, it also underscores the potential for further losses if Canoo fails to meet its operational and financial targets. Conclusion Based on the provided information, it appears that analysts are divided on Canoo’s prospects. While there is a consensus on a high upside potential, the stock’s past performance and the overall volatility of the EV market cannot be ignored. As an analyst, I would opine that Canoo may be considered a speculative buy, with a strong emphasis on the speculative nature of this investment. Investors should approach Canoo with caution and be prepared for the possibility of further volatility. The company’s future success will hinge on its ability to scale production, manage costs, and deliver on its promises to customers and investors. Given these considerations, Canoo could be a good buy for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon, but it may not be suitable for those seeking stability and predictable returns.

with an EV platform that maximizes cargo volume - Transaction is supported by a fully committed common stock PIPE of over $300 million, including investments from funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, among other institutional investors - As a result of outsized demand, the PIPE offering was meaningfully oversubscribed and upsized - Pro forma equity value of the merger is approximately $2.4 billion News provided by Canoo 18 Aug, 2020, 07:00 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X LOS ANGELES , Aug. 18, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Canoo Holdings Ltd. (""Canoo""), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) from the ground up, and Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (""HCAC"") (NASDAQ: HCAC ), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that would result in Canoo becoming a publicly listed company. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined operating company will be named Canoo Inc. and will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ""CNOO."" Continue Reading Canoo is a high-growth EV company, distinguished by its experienced team with an emphasis on engineering expertise and achievement. Canoo has designed the world's flattest modular ""skateboard"" platform that allows it to reimagine EV design, maximize usable interior space and support a wide range of vehicle applications. Canoo's skateboard architecture – a unique, self-contained, independently drivable rolling chassis – directly houses all of the most critical components of an EV. It will feature the market's first true steer-by-wire platform, which, along with a composite leaf spring suspension, enables the skateboard's flat structure and maximizes vehicle interior space. Canoo has also developed proprietary electric drivetrain and battery systems which are incorporated into the skateboard. All of Canoo's EVs will share the same skateboard and utilize different cabins or ""top hats"" that can be paired on top to create unique vehicles. This highly modular approach will facilitate efficient production at scale and enable Canoo to rapidly develop vehicles serving different market and consumer segments at reduced cost, as the majority of research and development and crash testing is built into the skateboard. Canoo Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Ulrich Kranz said, ""Today marks an important milestone of Canoo's effort to reinvent the development, production and go-to-market model of the electric vehicle industry. Our technology allows for rapid and cost-effective vehicle development through the world's flattest skateboard architecture, and we believe our subscription model will transform the consumer ownership experience. We are excited to partner with Hennessy Capital and we are energized to begin our journey through a shared passion to deliver an environmentally friendly and versatile vehicle development platform to the market."" Daniel Hennessy, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HCAC said, ""We are thrilled to partner with Canoo on their mission to reinvent urban mobility with a greener, simpler and more affordable portfolio of EV solutions. Unlike any other EV company, Canoo has created a go-to-market strategy that captures both B2C and B2B demand with the same skateboard architecture and technology that has already been validated by key partnerships such as with Hyundai. HCAC has an abiding commitment to sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and we are excited to serve as a catalyst to advance the launch of the Canoo vehicle offerings."" Led by Kranz, an automotive industry veteran with more than 30 years of executive experience at BMW, together with nearly 300 employees, the Canoo team has already shown its ability to deliver results by successfully designing, engineering and manufacturing its Beta vehicle in just 19 months and has completed more than 50 physical crash tests. Canoo expects to introduce its first model in 2022 that will be targeted at consumers in major urban markets. This lifestyle vehicle – eponymously named the canoo – leverages the company's low profile skateboard architecture to deliver the highest volume utilization across all classes of competitor vehicles currently on the market and has been purposefully developed for a subscription business model. In addition, Canoo has designed a commercial delivery B2B vehicle with expected availability in 2023 that directly capitalizes on Canoo's core skateboard technology. Canoo's delivery vehicle competes in a size segment that other competitors are currently not addressing and capitalizes on the need for a small, city-built, last-mile delivery solution. This high-efficiency platform maximizes cubic cargo volume and targets the fast growing last-mile delivery market. Canoo's consumer go-to-market strategy capitalizes on changing consumer preferences to deliver a month-to-month, commitment-free, subscription-based business model. With a single monthly fee and no upfront payment, Canoo members enjoy the benefits of an all-inclusive experience that, in addition to your own canoo vehicle, includes maintenance, warranty, registration and access to insurance and vehicle charging. This go-to-market model is designed to deliver an affordable and simplified customer experience while also enhancing lifetime vehicle revenue and margin to shareholders.

Transaction Overview The business combination values Canoo at an implied $2.4 billion pro forma equity value, at the $10.00 per share price and assuming no redemptions of HCAC's existing public stockholders. The combined company will receive approximately $600 million of proceeds from an upsized fully committed common stock PIPE offering of over $300 million , along with the approximately $300 million cash held in trust assuming no redemptions of HCAC's existing public stockholders. The boards of directors of both Canoo and HCAC have unanimously approved the proposed business combination, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, subject to, among other things, the approval by HCAC stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.

After a monster year for tech stocks, especially mega caps, an improving macroeconomic environment is likely to facilitate a rotation from the 2023 winners to stocks that are performing better in the environment of lower rates. Along these lines, many top-rated penny stocks could stage monster rallies in 2024. Why did they struggle in 2023?

Canoo said a year ago that it intended to provide at least 1,500 jobs by building a factory with 3-million-plus square feet of space at MAIP. Company CEO Tony Aquila said earlier this year that a plant capable of producing 300,000 vehicles annually could be operational in Pryor by 2024. “It is in delay mode, but that’s for a number of reasons,” MAIP Chief Administrative Officer David Stewart said Thursday before a regular meeting of the Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority, which operates the industrial park.

The stock market is challenged at best,” he continued. “Supply-chain issues are big, as they are with all companies, but especially with a start-up that has a new product. Canoo’s goal is to have this 100% made in the U.S., so that is also delaying the project. “Finally, construction costs are through the roof. So the right financial decision is to wait until these supply-chain issues and construction costs go down and the construction labor market builds.” Stewart said he’s had light conversations about these issues with Canoo. “There’s nothing that tells me that Canoo is not going to survive all this,” he said Thursday. But last month, Canoo reported first-quarter losses of $125.4 million, casting “substantial doubt” on its ability to move forward as a company in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Aquila has said the state of Oklahoma has committed about $300 million in nondiluted financial incentives to support the proposed Oklahoma facility, for which some ground has been cleared for construction. Canoo set up its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it wants to build an advanced manufacturing facility that could be operational late this year or early in 2023. “If you give the construction and supply-chain issues six to nine months, I would say that’s reasonable in my estimation,” Stewart said. “If your goal is to be 100%-American and you can’t get American parts, that’s kind of hard to fill that goal. It’s understandable. It makes sense in my mind from a business point of view that there will be a delay in production. “My understanding is that the cars are still being built, and Bentonville is still underway. So we are the tail end of the process for building the car in mass production. Because of our position in that cycle, it’s understandable that we would feel the effect of all of those issues compounded.” Stewart said Thursday that he also believes MAIP remains in contention for Project Ocean, widely reported to be an at least $3 billion electric battery plant for which Panasonic is seeking new operations in either Kansas or Oklahoma. It is unclear when Panasonic will make a decision. “We are not assuming they are not coming,” Stewart said. “We are going to go full force and do what we do to show Ocean that this is a great place to be.” Court challenges were filed this week protesting the legal sufficiency of a referendum petition that asked that a $300 million tax increment financing district go to a vote of the people. Approved by Mayes County commissioners in April, the 12-year TIF would encompass 588 acres inside MAIP to back initiatives such as Project Ocean. The challenges could be heard in mid-July, though a court date hasn’t been set, an assistant district attorney said. If the petition survives the challenges, it could be placed on the November ballot. “The fact that we have a couple of thousand people that want to take this to a vote does not mean that the public does not want it, and it doesn’t mean it’s not what the communities want,” Stewart said. “It’s democracy at its finest. They are following the process. “But we are not letting this slow us down in our effort to follow the path that we’ve been following. And that is getting the communities ready, getting the workforce ready and getting the land ready.” In addition to the proposed Mayes County incentive, Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill this spring to provide the firm with up to $698 million in rebates based on capital investment and job creation.

As a native Oklahoma, this company brought me back to the state where I was raised and share many memories. Having been a part of this project makes me feel so proud. This will not only create jobs but more importantly create generational impacts for my fellow Oklahomans.

Thank you to all of our partners and colleagues that have helped us get to this point. We couldn’t have done it without you.
