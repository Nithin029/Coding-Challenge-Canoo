Canoo expense structure,https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video,Canoo Shows Off Performance And Versatility Of Skateboard ...,"Canoo Shows Off Performance And Versatility Of Skateboard Platform For The First Time In Video | Press | Canoo | Electric Vehicles Universal Filter Code Home Press Videos Images Back to Canoo.com Home Press Videos Images Back to Canoo.com Canoo Shows Off Performance And Versatility Of Skateboard Platform For The First Time In Video Canoo transforms skateboard into “skatekart;” partners with professional racer to showcase performance capabilities Los Angeles, CA – (Sept. 24, 2020) – Canoo Holdings Ltd. (“Canoo”), a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EV) with a proprietary and highly versatile skateboard chassis for personal and business use, released a video showcasing the performance of its self-contained skateboard platform for the first time. For this video, Canoo transformed its skateboard into a cabin-less “skatekart” and professional racing driver, Sara Price , tested the performance of the platform, which will serve as the backbone of all Canoo vehicles. “I was blown away by how fun it was to drive,” said Price. “The overall performance was impressive. The skateboard felt powerful, with smooth and dynamic handling, especially during high speed cornering. The drive-by-wire steering was something new for me and it felt like it was built for the track.” High-Performance Powertrain Canoo developed a complete set of proprietary high-performance powertrain systems ideally suited for its modular skateboard platform. The powertrain systems were specifically developed entirely in-house to offer class competitive performance across its full range of vehicles. The skateboard supports dual, front or rear motor configurations, and is capable of achieving up to 500 horsepower and over 300 miles of range with dual motors. The rear primary unit is designed to deliver a maximum 300 horsepower and 450 Newton meters of torque, and the front unit is designed to deliver a maximum of 200 horsepower and 320 Newton meters of torque. Efficiency of the motors is designed to peak at 97% which is optimized for urban driving environments. Unlocking Potential with Steer-by-Wire Canoo’s skateboard platform includes the industry’s first true steer-by-wire system, which was inspired by performance race cars, to provide a highly responsive driving experience and versatility for Canoo’s future line up. Thanks to steer-by-wire, eliminating the mechanical steering connections between the cabin and skateboard, Canoo is able to demonstrate for the first time how the steering wheel can be moved to suit any cabin design or driver positioning. This versatility is well suited to accommodate full autonomy once commercially available, as well as for right hand drive and Canoo’s future delivery vehicles. The variable ratio, speed sensitive by-wire electronic power steering also introduces an opportunity to leverage software to customize the driving experience depending on user preferences and use cases, for example, by changing the lock-to-lock ratio to provide more precision driving. Independent Skateboard, Flexible Use Unlike other platforms on the market, Canoo’s skateboard is uniquely modular, offering a truly self-contained, fully functional rolling chassis, so much so that it can be driven entirely independently. The skateboard architecture directly houses all of the most critical components of an electric vehicle, including its industry leading steer-by-wire platform, a transverse composite leaf spring suspension system, an advanced fully electric drivetrain, a proprietary battery compartment and battery thermal management systems, power electronics, vehicle controls, crash absorption structures and autonomous driving components, among others. Each of these component systems has been engineered for optimal performance and efficient packaging into Canoo’s compact platform, with a strong emphasis given to functional integration. “We wanted to showcase our skateboard’s performance and prove that our rolling chassis is a truly self-contained unit with everything needed to drive built inside,” said Ulrich Kranz, In Charge of Canoo. “We have revolutionized the platform design concept with a chassis that can be easily married with different cabins, with little adjustment, enabling us to get new vehicles on the road faster and cheaper. By keeping the most critical and expensive part of the vehicle uniform in all our models, it allows us to rapidly and cost effectively bring to market a full line-up of EVs.” Canoo’s core technological backbone is its skateboard vehicle platform that is common to all its vehicles. By utilizing a common platform, Canoo will be able to rapidly scale subsequent vehicle programs at a significantly lower capital cost because it reduces expenses in research and development, testing and manufacturing. Canoo’s skateboard provides a significant advancement in automotive technology. With the company’s skateboard, along with an efficient design and proprietary production process, Canoo anticipates new vehicle models can be developed in as little as 18-24 months, significantly faster than the average estimated timeframe across the automotive industry. The dimensions of Canoo’s skateboard were deliberately selected to suit the needs of more than 75% of the most common passenger and light duty commercial vehicles on the road today. World’s Flattest Electric Vehicle Platform Canoo has developed the world’s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the canoo , which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo’s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. Video Credits Canoo’s in-house design team worked with Porch House to create the film which was shot in California’s Rabbit Dry Lake . The piece is directed by Cody Autterson, produced by Andrew Schneider with Jared Fadel as the Director of Photography. Still photography is by Jack Schroeder and Jenna Norman captured the behind the scenes photos. What’s Next for Canoo Canoo expects to introduce the canoo in 2022, followed by a series of delivery vehicles set to launch in 2023 and a sport vehicle to come thereafter. About Canoo Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, reinventing the automotive landscape with bold innovations in design, pioneering technologies, and a unique business model that defies traditional ownership to put customers first. Distinguished by its experienced team – numbering nearly 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies – Canoo has designed a modular skateboard platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. Canoo expects to launch its first consumer model in 2022, simply named the canoo and available only by subscription, followed shortly after by a last-mile delivery vehicle and a sport vehicle, each built off of the same underlying skateboard platform.

For investors, please visit investors.canoo.com . Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results CANOO INC.

For investors, please visit investors.canoo.com . Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA “EBITDA” is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results CANOO INC.

Selects Canoo as Its New Name and Announces Key Hires News provided by Canoo 25 Mar, 2019, 03:01 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X LOS ANGELES , March 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- EVELOZCITY, a Los Angeles based company creating electric vehicles (EV) made for subscription, announced today that Canoo is its new name. Canoo will be a boutique Californian brand that will offer four unique vehicles in cities by subscription only: A lifestyle vehicle A personal commuter vehicle A last-mile delivery vehicle A ride-hailing vehicle ""We picked Canoo because it sounds distinctive, looks cool and creates a feeling of both relaxation and movement,"" said Stefan Krause , who is In Charge of Canoo. ""For thousands of years, a canoe has been a simple, sustainable transportation device used all over the world."" The Company will launch its first model in the U.S. beginning in 2021. By leveraging the benefits of a flat EV platform, Canoo is able to create unique vehicles that look nothing like what is on the road today. Canoo's vehicles will move away from traditional three box car design, which have separate compartments for the engine, passengers and luggage. Instead, the Company is embracing a minimalist design that maximizes interior space. The lifestyle vehicle, for example, will have the exterior footprint of a compact car, with the interior space of a large SUV. While only 15-months-old, the Company already has more than 350 team members and is growing steadily. Canoo is excited to announce several key hires: Olivier Bellin has been appointed to be In Charge of Operations, which includes supply chain, program management and project financials. Olivier spent 20 years at STMicroelectronics, a Geneva based semiconductor leader, where he ultimately advanced to serve as VP Finance & CFO of the Americas. He was also VP of Supply Chain for California startup ICON Aircraft. Canoo also announces that the former President of BMW Manufacturing LLC, Clemens Schmitz-Justen , recently joined to be In Charge of Manufacturing. Clemens will be responsible for overseeing Canoo's contract manufacturing strategy. With his help, the Company will take an asset lean approach, outsourcing production of its vehicles in the U.S. and China . Beginning mid-April, James Cox will join Canoo from Uber to be In Charge of Digital. James spent the last four years at Uber's headquarters, where he led global product operations for the Uber rider app. Prior to that, he was part of the product team that launched and built UberPOOL and spent a year launching ride-sharing (UberX) in Australia . James will be critical in setting Canoo's strategy for digital services, including the implementation of the Company's cloud-based customer offerings and underlying ecosystem. Shi (Time) Aobing was appointed In Charge of HR in China and joins the Company after spending 11 years at SAIC Motor, a Fortune Global 500 company. During his tenure there, Time worked on a joint initiative (now called Banma) with Alibaba Group, to build the world's first mass-produced Internet car, and he was responsible for building the organizational structure and growing the team. Now, Time is responsible for growing the Canoo team in Shanghai , which is instrumental for the Company as the U.S. and China are the two most important regions. There are 3 key areas where Canoo is taking a unique approach: Unique Products: A design that will look like nothing on the road today by challenging the norms of space and function, as well as offering a lean User Interface (UI) Next-generation Business Model: A new approach to the EV market that focuses on reducing production and infrastructure costs while increasing revenue 100% subscription, secured by blockchain technology Unique Product Design Typical automotive styling, expressive sculpture, and grille shape are not meaningful enough to solve today's issues surrounding mobility and vehicle usage. Canoo is creating unique vehicles to address the current needs and use cases of customers. There is no need for electric vehicles to look like traditional cars, yet today they still do. Canoo plans to change that. Canoo is creating an all-new uncompromising EV design that looks and offers functionality that is nothing like the cars on the road today. Lean User Interface Traditional car makers have an outdated approach that is focused on proprietary infotainment systems and overwhelming screens, but most customers just want to use the very same services they are used to having on their phones when inside the vehicle. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Canoo is developing a lean user interface that easily connects with the user's own existing digital life. Next-generation Business Model Building electric vehicles is expensive, therefore, Canoo is rethinking the traditional automotive business model. Canoo's cost structure is very lean. The Company is focused on lowering costs and generating higher revenue through: Vehicle Architecture Canoo is developing a ""skateboard"" architecture, which will house a battery and electric drivetrain that can achieve up to 300 miles of range. All of Canoo's vehicles will share the same underpinning. Different cabins or ""top hats"" will be married on top to create the four unique vehicles. Leveraging the same fixed and flat skateboard allows for reduced R&D costs, efficient production and a better use of interior space. The skateboard houses the most expensive components of the vehicle and is designed in a way that most crash testing does not need to be repeated per vehicle, reducing the vehicle's development cycle timeline and costs. Lifecycle Electric powertrains inherently have a long low-maintenance life. The Company will take cues from the airline industry and refurbish the vehicles to keep them up to date over their lifecycle. Contract Manufacturing Canoo is asset-lean. The Company will use contract manufacturing to outsource production in the U.S. and China . Partnership approach For areas like autonomous driving that require very specialized expertise, Canoo is working with leaders in many fields to integrate the latest technologies into the vehicles to offer the best possible product experience to its subscribers. Direct to Consumer Canoo will not have a physical sales network. The Company will offer its product directly to customers. 100% subscription, using blockchain technology Subscription Canoo's subscriptions will have no specific duration commitment. There will be different packages available from 24/7 access, to more flexible options - each for affordable payments that include insurance and other services. Blockchain Canoo products and services will run on secure blockchain technology. The Company believes blockchain will be a great enabler for a whole new wave of services and business models for the automotive industry, including vehicle sharing. About Canoo Canoo is a Los Angeles based company creating electric vehicles (EV) made for subscription. There are 3 key areas where Canoo is taking a different approach from the industry norm. First, a unique product design that looks nothing like what is on the road today and a lean user interface (UI). Second, the Company has adopted a next-generation business model for electric vehicles that focuses on reducing costs and increasing revenue. Third, Canoo will be available by subscription only, secured by blockchain technology. The boutique Californian EV brand plans to launch its first vehicle in cities in 2021, beginning in the U.S., and in China shortly thereafter.

Canoo trades under the ticker $GOEV. Members Online • Drink_water_today ADMIN MOD Can Canoo really start production in Oklahoma City factory by Q2 or Q3 2023? Manufacturing Not trying to spread FUD, just trying to be realistic. I'm a Canoo bull that owns a lot of shares. Faraday Future is also in similar path as Canoo. Buy a existing factory and retool it to manufacture electric car. FF raise $1 billion to retool the small factory to build there car. Well, they are more than 1 year late. They recently announced they will SOP in march 2023 if they can get another $150-$170 million. (FF gonna need to use that money to paid suppliers for car parts, Canoo will need to do that as well) If FF can really start producing cars by March 2023, it would have taken them more than 20 months to retool a small factory... So Canoo can do this in less than 9 months? I believe I am comparing apples to apples here. Both have financial trouble, both management have no previous car manufacturing experience and both are startups. What FF go through, Canoo will go through similar path. In my opinion if Canoo can start producing saleable cars in December 2023 in low volume, it would be major accomplishment Read more &nbsp; &nbsp; TOPICS Gaming Valheim Genshin Impact Minecraft Pokimane Halo Infinite Call of Duty: Warzone Path of Exile Hollow Knight: Silksong Escape from Tarkov Watch Dogs: Legion Sports NFL NBA Megan Anderson Atlanta Hawks Los Angeles Lakers Boston Celtics Arsenal F.C.

Canoo Acquires Manufacturing Assets to Increase Vehicle Assembly Capacity Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ: GOEV) announces the purchase of manufacturing assets at a discounted price of over 80 percent of estimated value, aiming to scale production at its Oklahoma City facility and reduce capital expenditures in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of high-value manufacturing assets by Canoo Inc. at an 80% discount is a significant financial maneuver that could have a positive effect on the company's capital efficiency and cost structure. By reducing the capital expenditure required to scale production, Canoo may potentially improve its operating margins and cash flow position. This strategic purchase allows the company to allocate resources more effectively, which is especially prudent in a high cost of capital environment. Investors would be interested in how these savings could translate into improved financial guidance and whether such aggressive asset acquisition strategies might become a recurring tactic to enhance shareholder value. The reduced capital expenditure and improved guidance can be seen as a positive signal to the market, potentially leading to an upward revision in the stock's valuation by analysts. Market Research Analyst Canoo's strategic purchase at a steep discount reflects a broader trend in the electric vehicle (EV) industry where companies are seeking to optimize production costs amid increasing competition and price sensitivity. The ability to acquire assets at such a discount may provide Canoo with a competitive edge, allowing them to scale production without proportionally increasing costs. This could be particularly advantageous as the EV market continues to grow and consumer demand for affordable electric vehicles rises. From a market perspective, Canoo's actions could prompt a reevaluation of supply chain and asset acquisition strategies among competitors. Such a move might lead to a ripple effect, where other companies in the sector also seek similar opportunities, potentially leading to a more cost-competitive landscape. Economist The aggressive procurement of discounted manufacturing assets by Canoo is indicative of a strategic response to the increasing cost of capital. In an environment where interest rates may be rising, companies like Canoo are incentivized to pursue cost-saving measures to maintain their investment and growth trajectories. This approach could mitigate some of the financial pressures that come with a tightening monetary policy. Moreover, the investment in advanced manufacturing jobs in Oklahoma may contribute to regional economic development, potentially stimulating local economies through job creation and increased economic activity. This could also serve as a case study for the impact of strategic capital deployment in a specific sector on the broader economy. 01/08/2024 - 07:00 AM High-value equipment of an electric vehicle manufacturer purchased at a discounted price of over 80 percent of estimated value Justin, Texas, Jan.  08, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ: GOEV), a leading high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced the purchase of manufacturing assets at dramatically reduced prices to scale production at its Oklahoma City facility. Canoo purchased a cache of manufacturing assets, from robotics to controls processing equipment that will be used to build vehicle cabins. As Canoo scales manufacturing to make additional customer deliveries in 2024, the company is continuously exploring ways to acquire high-value equipment at reduced prices through alternative routes. Canoo purchased the assets at a discounted price of over 80 percent of estimated value. “We are a creative and adaptive team and continue to find alternative ways to acquire manufacturing assets to meet our production goals and customer commitments,” said Greg Ethridge, Chief Financial Officer at Canoo. “With the increasing cost of capital environment, the Canoo team has been diligent in deploying capital and has aggressively pursued critical manufacturing assets at reduced prices.” Ramesh Murthy, Chief Accounting Officer at Canoo, added: “While many companies invested in capital equipment prematurely, we continue to phase our investment with our growth. These opportunities to acquire assets at significantly discounted prices have allowed us to further reduce our 2023 capital expenditures and also to improve our guidance by millions of dollars.” These newly purchased assets will be used in Oklahoma to drive Canoo’s manufacturing strategy and create advanced manufacturing jobs in the state of Oklahoma.

Tony Aquila, CEO, Canoo Tony Aquila: Thank you, Kunal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our Q1 2023 results. Last earnings, which was less than six weeks ago, we provided a comprehensive update, which included important legacy issues related to the company's past management. As disclosed in our Q4 2022 filing, we reached a settlement with the staff of the SEC, and we continue to wait for the final approval of the settlement by the commission, which we hope to see in the coming quarter. We understand that the Staff's investigation of former senior executives remains ongoing. The management team continues to focus on resolving the remaining legacy issues, some of which we will cover in this earnings release. I encourage you to watch Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's comments about the traditional automotive industry at Berkshire's recent shareholder meeting. The traditional auto manufacturing business is tough, which we completely agree. And that's why we are not trying to be a traditional OEM. But a TEM, which we introduced with the re-founding and we will cover more starting now and in the coming quarters as we go to market. Rapid rise in interest rates, uncertainty of future fed policy, unstable regional banks, and unresolved debt limit discussions are continuing to create headwinds for U.S. and European economies, which directly affect the traditional automotive industry. This will be a challenging period for the traditional automotive industry. We have all seen the numbers coming in from others with weakening demand for consumer vehicles, due to the rising cost of capital, continuing fears of inflation and the in-bound zero emission technologies. Medium to long term demand for zero emission technology driven vehicles will continue to grow rapidly. As we can see, the average age vehicle has reached an all-time high between 12 years and 14 years depending on the segment. These numbers prove that the stage is set for zero emission technology driven vehicles, especially in the TAMs and geographies we are focused on, where there is current demand and high volume buyers. We also believe that we are focused on the geographies and segments where there is available capital and favorable regulatory conditions. Our strategy to deliver a high return on capital platform starting with our commercial customers who order in volume and across multi-year cycle. For the overall industry, weakening consumer demand and higher negative margins on early production units for many of the newcomers that chose to put in place large production facilities ahead of confirmed orders has been a challenge. Our strategy is different and therefore has different challenges that we are focused on remediating as we raise very targeted milestone driven capital. We are starting to see improving pricing conditions for our platform. We have a multi-year organically growing order book. 200 plus mile EPA confirmed range with our highly efficient configuration for last mile delivery used cases, which is often 30% to 50% higher than the competition. We remain focused on range and performance optimization by customer and by customer used case. In other words, you need to know exactly what range and the operating environment conditions that exist for that specific customer. Fewer parts drive lower complexity to manufacture that result in lower cost and we will start to share our clear path to cash flow positive. We had gained strong support from our commercial customers on our roll-out and go to market strategy. We don't care what it is designed to do. We care about what it can do and must do for our customers to get a high return on capital. We are continuously focused on our extensive testing and customer validation programs, which is reflected in our order book because many of these customers have already run or are currently running advanced in-depth tests with our platform and we will have some additional announcements shortly. Previously, we explained our early decision to onshore manufacturing and jobs to the U.S. While it may not have seemed like the right move at the time, this has positioned us well to benefit from the current environment. Our LDV is eligible for the EV commercial tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Currently, this is not available to many others as discussed due to pricing and offshoring. As we said above, the OEMs have always focused on establishing large capacity upfront, but this has often been an anchor during tough economic conditions and radical changes in technology. Our decision to stage how we bring capacity online with the ability to expand at an incremental basis we believe will prove to be more prudent capital allocation and geographic expansion strategy. We invested our capital on democratizing our IP and assets to address some voids and white spaces we anticipated in the existing and emerging TAMs for our technology. We will share more in the coming quarters. Another benefit of our strategy is that we focused on launching a commercial product without incurring high costs and manufacturing risks associated with meeting consumer expectations for interior trim and infotainment systems. This approach allows us to require less capital. Additionally, as we scale our operations and reach breakeven margins faster, we expect to achieve positive cash flow at lower volumes. Our primary focus is on achieving these goals, and we are continuously working to refine our confidence in our ability to do so. The transition to manufacturing and the workforce transition in Oklahoma will enable us to ramp up our headcount more efficiently from a total cost perspective. We are observing a significant labor arbitrage as we adjust the mix and headcount ratios between our Oklahoma and California workforces. As we continue to mature, it is crucial for us to enhance our ability to coordinate and optimize our cost structure. In terms of manufacturing, we have secured a long-term lease for the OKC manufacturing facility. To reduce capital burden and dilution for the company, we structured a sale leaseback through my family office. As a committed long-term believer and shareholder, we designed the initial payment to include shares, enabling the company to redeploy the cash for other time-sensitive priorities. Furthermore, on a diluted and non-dilutive basis, we raised and deployed the most capital in any quarter since the [de-SPACing]. While bringing manufacturing is a challenging task, we acknowledge the difficulties and are embracing them. We have assembled a great team with the experience and passion for continuous innovation. Our focus is on doing things right, better, and differently while reducing complexity in the advanced manufacturing process. We are also learning from the challenges faced by those currently ramping up production. Our goal is to avoid using off-the-shelf third-party parts and assemblies that are not harmonized and can add complexity. We aim to streamline our supply chains and address software integration issues across multiple independent parties. However, we are still dealing with legacy matters, particularly in harmonizing our supply chain for production. This challenge is compounded by our just-in-time milestone-driven capital discipline, which has caused some fatigue, friction, and capital leakage. Despite these obstacles, we are actively working to improve efficiency in production. At present, our team is installing and working on the setup and functional validation of the general assembly line at our Oklahoma City Manufacturing Facility. This includes the Body-in-White mainline, which we recently shipped from Detroit to OKC. Our target is to exit 2023 at a 20,000 run rate, allowing us to reach a 40,000 run rate by 2024. This approach is based on our current order book and our emphasis on targeted just-in-time capital expenditures and achieving our target gross margins. While some may have criticized our small NASA order, it is essential to understand the significance of our partnership with NASA. We are closely collaborating with NASA's team of scientists and engineers to optimize vehicle performance and functionality, particularly regarding interior behaviors, comfort, safety, and security. The first 8 miles of an astronaut's journey begin in a Canoo, which makes NASA a crucial partner and customer. Their investment has been invaluable, enabling us to learn and innovate as we prepare to deliver unique interior configurations based on our highly functional futuristic design. In fact, NASA's Artemis team, led by Charlie Blackwell, recently visited our facilities as part of an important milestone review. This milestone was highlighted on social media by NASA, and we invite you to look it up if you haven't seen it yet. Working with the impressive innovators at NASA is an honor for us, and we are on track to deliver the vehicles in the upcoming quarter. As we said earlier, we have a strong resilient multi-year order book with improving pricing condition. Our order book is now valued at 2.8 billion. It grew 5% quarter-over-quarter in Stage 2 and Stage 3 orders, and we will announce shortly the finalization of two important sales agreements, one with a Fortune 100 and another with a Fortune 500. This is further validation that our work-ready platform meets and exceeds the needs of our targeted customers. In closing, we have to continue to do more with less. This is an important and complex phase with many moving pieces. We know we have to prove ourselves and we are focused on doing just that. Now, turning it over to Ken and Ramesh who will provide an update on our capital raise strategy and give you a deeper view of our financial performance and our projections. Ken? Ken Manget, CFO, Canoo Ken Manget Thank you, Tony. As we discussed in the last call, we finalized our 2023, 2024 capital plan and are executing on moving from a just-in-time capital raise strategy. So, as Tony described before, which is a more milestone-driven strategy. Our demand is multi-year contractual and more certain. Our manufacturing processes are easier to execute. Unlike others, our production matches our demand versus being nearly potential sales. This means less capital expenditure is required to achieve volume thresholds for positive gross margins. Our focus is to continue to achieve alignment of our capital formation and allocation with a ramp-up of manufacturing. Among the most notable recent dilutive and non-dilutive capital initiatives, a 52.5 million registered direct offering in February 2023, 48 million convertible debenture which was issued in April of 2023 at a 1% coupon maturing on June 24, 2024. A 43 million sale leaseback for the Oklahoma City facility with tenant improvements. 15 million from the exercise of warrants held by Yorkville. In addition, we have [circa] [ph] 300 million in total access to liquidity via each of the 149 million ATM and 149 million PPA facilities. We are focused on managing our cash and improving our synchronization of capital allocation as we move to production. Ramesh will now walk through the results. Ramesh Murthy, CAO, Canoo Ramesh Murthy Thank you, Ken. Turning to cash flow. We ended the quarter with 6.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. After giving effect to the issuance in sale of the convertible debentures of 48 million and the exercise of $15 million in warrants, our cash balance would have been 69.7 million on March 31, 2023. Cash used in operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was 67.2 million, compared to 120.3 million in the prior year period. Our capital expenditures of 18.4 million for the quarter-ended March 31, 2023, compared to 28.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, is impacted by the migration to Oklahoma City. Net cash provided by financing activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023, was 56.1 million, compared to net cash provided in financing activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, of 9.5 million. Our cash outflow in Q1 2023 was approximately 30% lower than our average cash outflow per month in 2022. We continue to optimize cash as we move into Q2 of 2023. Moving to the income statement. Our first quarter 2023 results are as follows: Research and development expenses, which include investing in manufacturing activities, totaled 47.1 million for the quarter, compared to 82.5 million in the prior year period, a 43% reduction from Q1 of 2022. SG&A expense was 29.8 million for the quarter, compared to 55.6 million in the prior year period, a 46% reduction from Q1 of 2022. A 25% to 30% reduction in our annual operating expenses, compared to 2022, primarily resulting from increased focus on our objectives. Some of these reductions include a 40% to 50% reduction in professional fees, a 10% to 15% reduction in IT infrastructure, and a 20% to 30% reduction in human capital cost from workforce transition to support manufacturing in Oklahoma, labor arbitrage benefits, and change in labor mix that Tony has mentioned. Our focus on confirmed multi-year commercial orders with less manufacturing complexity allows us to achieve positive margins sooner and requires lower capital expenditures and working capital needs, compared to others in the industry. We have a dual path manufacturing investment strategy, which adjusts for the amount of capital we access in the short-term. Our total investment to date has been approximately 1.4 billion, which excludes the recently closed sale leaseback by Tony's family office. Our entrepreneurial approach will leverage our total investment to date through a combination of in-house outsourced, along with a phased ramp approach, which is comprised of 329 million of total invested capital expenditures to date and requiring 140 million to 200 million in additional capital expenditures to reach the 20,000 run rate in manufacturing readiness, which we continue to refine across our partners and long-term shareholders. Based on our current models, we believe a 40,000 run rate in manufacturing readiness is achievable by 2024 with an incremental capital expenditure of only $90 million to $120 million. Thereby allowing us to target gross margin positive in 2025 based on our current pricing. GAAP net loss was 90.7 million for the quarter, compared to GAAP net loss of 125.4 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was negative 67.1 million for the quarter, compared to negative 117.4 million in the prior year period. Moving to our guidance. Our guidance for Q2 2023 is as follows: OpEx, $40 million to $60 million, excluding stock compensation and depreciation. CapEx of $10 million to $20 million. We are targeting next quarter to release the full-year guidance. Turning it back to the operator for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Please state your question. Amit Dayal: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Tony, just to begin with, maybe on these SEC related comments you made, is there any impact from what is happening on that side with respect to the operational side of things and your ability to deliver or start shipments by the end of this year? Tony Aquila: No. As we stated, the company's activity has been concluded while they continue to do more around former employees, but we're just waiting for the commission to sign-off and give us their approval. Amit Dayal: Okay, understood. And then with respect to the activity going on to set-up production lines, etc., right now? Are you thinking, are you looking – the visibility you have, I mean do you see some initial production getting underway by the end of the second quarter or early third quarter? And then you ramp from there, could you just give us a little bit of a timeline on how this will play out? Tony Aquila: Yeah. So, as we said, we've done some limited production, right? We got NASA. We did 15 LDVs and we're using them for extensive testing and activities with customers, as well as we'll be delivering the NASA vehicles in the quarter. So, it would be the beginning of us in the coming quarter starting to generate some revenue as well. So, it will be limited. We're being a little wider on things just because we don't want to disappoint people. In fact, we want to exceed expectations. And you can see in this quarter release we gave a lot more detailed information, right? So, you can double check it to your models and you can see. We'll be delivering vehicles and the focus is very heavily on exiting at a 20,000 run rate. Amit Dayal: Okay. Thank you. And just maybe last one, the 40 million to 60 million OpEx guidance for 2Q, will that – will you be at a similar range for, you know, 3Q and 4Q, or should we expect some ramp to take place as [production increases] ? Tony Aquila: Yes. I mean, it's going to change a bit. So, it'll go up and down. I think what you're seeing with us in the approach we have taken, which is to figure out how to be, you know as I said, I think Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger said it well. The traditional model is very, very tough. And every 15 years to 20 years, it has a terrible cycle, right, [3 car generation] [ph]. And we focused on something that was more technology-driven, which allowed us to have an expandable format, as well as a geographical expansion strategy and then where appropriate, when appropriate to have mass production, which we secured in the prior site for the long-term. So, we'll step into that. We'll raise capital accordingly. And we'll give guidance more and more in-depth and as we talked about earlier, our plan is to get full-year guidance in the next quarter. Amit Dayal: Okay. Thank you, Tony. That's all I have. Tony Aquila: Thank you, Amit. Jaime Perez: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. As far as capital equipment is [focused] [ph], do you have everything you need and the CapEx, and I mean the cash that you generated and let me raise – is that just used for working capital? I mean, what else do we need to get to the 20,000 run rate and then maybe to the 40,000 run rate as far as capital equipment? Tony Aquila: Yes. So, there's a dual path we had to do, right, Jaime? Otherwise, we have to raise a lot more capital and in the current valuations, which we believe are below par. We're going to be very conservative about the way we do it. So that's why we really dug deep and developed a dual path. That dual path has an in-source outsource model, right? As we shift it more to in-source over time, that will be as we have more visibility, more of the things we do in-house at our standards and as we scale. So, then the answer is no, we don't have everything if you think of the in-source model. If you think of the in-source, outsource model, we have pretty much everything. There's still some stuff. I don't think you can really say you'll ever have everything you possibly need, but these are the key areas that matter, like your Body-in-White, your paint, your GA, and your tooling. Jaime Perez: Now, we're hearing from other EVs that the supply chain issues for the EVs OEM has been solved, but they've been having problems with the suppliers. I mean, did you foresee that problem with your third-party suppliers not delivering through supply constraints or logistics problem? Tony Aquila: ""So, look, I think the uniqueness of our design and the reduction of parts and increase of assemblies and taking a more technology-driven approach, our issues with suppliers have been from the legacy matters where they were more focused on a traditional large volume outsource model. And we've been – in the re-founding, obviously, we fatigued quite a few of our suppliers because we had to get them to change to the model that we want to go, which is a ramping model. And so, the friction we have in the supply chain, I'd say is more self-inflicted with the exception of any given day there are 20 parts that are just on a general industry concern. Jaime Perez: And my final question, do you have any updates on the Walmart order for us? [indiscernible]. Tony Aquila: Yes. So, I think if you see some of the comments in the script, you'll see we'll have some announcements in the coming quarter, but things continue. Jaime Perez: That's all I have for tonight. Thanks. Tony Aquila:  Look, I just want to give a big shout out to all the people who have been helping us while we have done the re-founding to our suppliers, to our partners, to our customers, to our investors, and the hardworking associates that have had to innovate in a very different way. And we're seeing a very good future. We got a lot to prove. We intend to prove it. And we have experience in building companies from scratch. And we know that every deal is a new deal, and these are tough times, and we've got to execute and optimize the way we use cash and build shareholder value. I want to give a big shout out to everybody who's supporting us. Thank you. 0 comments 4 likes.

A B.N. Morris Canoe Company wood-and-canvas canoe built approximately 1912 Birchbark canoe at Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor , Maine Bark canoe in Australia, Howitt 1904 A family riding a canoe in the Western Region of Ghana A canoe is a lightweight narrow water vessel , typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using paddles. In British English , the term canoe can also refer to a kayak , while canoes are then called Canadian or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks. However, for official competition purposes, the American distinction between a kayak and a canoe is almost always adopted. [1] Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed for use with sails or outriggers . Until the mid-19th century, the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places is still used as such, sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor . Where the canoe played a key role in history, such as the Northern United States , Canada, and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture . Canoes are now widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing , whitewater , touring and camping , freestyle and general recreation . Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936 . The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape, length , and construction material. Historically, canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame, [2] but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass or those incorporating kevlar , or graphite . History [ edit ] Frances Anne Hopkins : Shooting the Rapids (Quebec) (1879), Voyageur canoe. The word canoe came into English from the Spanish/Portuguese word canoa . They in turn had adopted the word from the Arawakan languages of the Caribbean for a dugout canoe, kanawa . [3] Dugouts [ edit ] Dugout canoe of pirogue type in the Solomon Islands Main article: Dugout canoe Many peoples made dugout canoes, by carving out a single piece of wood; either a whole trunk , or a slab of trunk from particularly large trees. [4] [5] Constructed between 8200 and 7600 BC, and found in the Netherlands , the Pesse canoe may be the oldest known canoe. Excavations in Denmark reveal the use of dugouts and paddles during the Ertebølle period, ( c. 5300 – c. 3950 BC ). [6] One of the oldest canoes in the world is the Dufuna canoe in Nigeria. It is the oldest boat to be discovered in Africa, and, by varying accounts, either the second or third oldest known worldwide. [7] The canoe is currently in Damaturu , the Yobe State capital. [7] Canoes have also played a vital role in the colonisation of the Pre-Columbian Caribbean as they represented the only possibility of reaching the Caribbean Islands from mainland South America. [8] Around 3500 BC ancient Amerindian groups colonised the first Caribbean Islands using single-hulled canoes. [9] Only a very few Pre-Columbian Caribbean canoes have been found. [10] There are several families of trees that could have been used to construct Caribbean canoes. These include woods of the mahogany family (Meliaceae) such as the Cuban mahogany ( Swietenia mahagoni ), that can reach heights of 30–35 m and the red cedar ( Cedrela odorata ), that can grow up to 60 m in height., as well as the ceiba genus (Malvacae), such as Ceiba pentandra , than can grow up to 60–70 m tall. [11] It is likely that these canoes were built in a variety of sizes. Ranging from fishing canoes, holding one or a few individuals, to larger ones able to carry as many as a few dozen people that could have been used to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland. Reports by historical chroniclers claim to have witnessed a canoe ""containing 40 to 50 Caribs [...] when it came out to trade with a visiting English ship"". [12] There is still much dispute regarding the use of sails in Caribbean canoes. Some archaeologists doubt that oceanic transportation would have been possible without the use of sails, as winds and currents would have carried the canoes off course. [13] However, no evidence of a sail or a Caribbean canoe that could have made use of a sail has been found. Furthermore, no historical sources mention Caribbean canoes with sails. One possibility could be that canoes with sails were initially used in the Caribbean but later abandoned before European contact. This, however, seems unlikely, as long-distance trade continued in the Caribbean even after the prehistoric colonisation of the islands. Hence, it is likely that early Caribbean colonists made use of canoes without sails. [14] Native American groups of the north Pacific coast made dugout canoes in a number of styles for different purposes, from western red-cedar ( Thuja plicata ) or yellow-cedar ( Chamaecyparis nootkatensis ), depending on availability. [4] Different styles were required for ocean-going vessels versus river boats, and for whale-hunting versus seal-hunting versus salmon -fishing. The Quinault of Washington State built shovel-nose canoes, with double bows, for river travel that could slide over a logjam without needing to be portaged . The Kootenai of British Columbia province made sturgeon-nosed canoes from pine bark, designed to be stable in windy conditions on Kootenay Lake . [15] In recent years First Nations in British Columbia and Washington State have been revitalizing the ocean-going canoe tradition. Beginning in the 1980s, the Heiltsuk and Haida were early leaders in this movement. The paddle to Expo 86 in Vancouver by the Heiltsuk , and the 1989 Paddle to Seattle were early instances of this. In 1993 a large number of canoes paddled from up and down the coast to Bella Bella in its first canoe festival – 'Qatuwas. [16] The revitalization continued – and Tribal Journeys began with trips to various communities held in most years. Australian Aboriginal people made canoes from hollowed out tree trunks , as well as from tree bark. [17] The indigenous people of the Amazon commonly used Hymenaea ( Fabaceae ) trees. [ citation needed ] Bark canoes [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] Some Australian Aboriginal peoples made bark canoes. [17] They could only be made from the bark of certain trees (usually red gum or box gum ) and during summer. After cutting the outline of the required size and shape, a digging stick was used to cut through the bark to the hardwood, and the bark was then slowly prised out using numerous smaller sticks. The slab of bark was held in place by branches or hand-woven rope, and after separation from the tree, lowered to the ground and small fires lit on the inside of the bark. This would cause the bark to dry out and curl upwards, after which the ends could be pulled together and stitched with hemp and plugged with mud. It was then allowed to mature, with frequent applications of grease and ochre . The remaining tree was later dubbed a canoe tree by Europeans. [18] Because of the porosity of the bark, they did not last too long (about two years [18] ), and were mainly used for fishing or crossing rivers or lakes rather than long journeys. They were usually propelled by punting with a long stick. [19] Another type of bark canoe was made out of a type of stringybark gum known as Messmate stringybark ( Eucalyptus obliqua ), where the bark was pleated and tied at each end, with a framework of cross-ties and ribs. This type was known as a pleated or tied bark canoe. Bark strips could also be sewn together to make larger canoes, known as sewn bark canoes. [20] Americas [ edit ] Innu building a birch bark canoe, Mi'kmaq camp, Matapedia (?), QC (?), Alexander Henderson, circa 1870, Canada Many indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes. They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame, but other types could be used if birch was scarce. At a typical length of 4.3 m (14 ft) and weight of 23 kg (50 lb), the canoes were light enough to be portaged , yet could carry a lot of cargo, even in shallow water. Although susceptible to damage from rocks, they are easily repaired. [21] Their performance qualities were soon recognized by early European settler colonials , and canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America , [22] with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in 1615. In 1603 a canoe was brought to Sir Robert Cecil 's house in London and rowed on the Thames by Virginian Indians from Tsenacommacah . [23] In 1643 David Pietersz. de Vries recorded a Mohawk canoe in Dutch possession at Rensselaerswyck capable of transporting 225 bushels of maize. [24] [25] René de Bréhant de Galinée , a French missionary who explored the Great Lakes in 1669, declared: ""The convenience of these canoes is great in these waters, full of cataracts or waterfalls, and rapids through which it is impossible to take any boat. When you reach them you load canoe and baggage upon your shoulders and go overland until the navigation is good; and then you put your canoe back into the water, and embark again."" [26] American painter, author and traveler George Catlin wrote that the bark canoe was ""the most beautiful and light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented"". [27] These antique dug out canoes are in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the Historic Center of Quito . The first explorer to cross the North American continent, Alexander Mackenzie , used canoes extensively, as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition . In the North American fur trade the Hudson's Bay Company 's voyageurs used three types of canoe: [28] The rabaska or canot du maître was designed for the long haul from the St. Lawrence River to western Lake Superior . Its dimensions were: length approximately 11 m (35 ft), beam 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft), and height about 76 cm (30 in). It could carry 60 packs weighing 41 kg (90 lb), and 910 kg (2,000 lb) of provisions. With a crew of eight or ten (paddling or rowing), they could make three knots over calm waters. Four to six men could portage it, bottom up. Henry Schoolcraft declared it ""altogether one of the most eligible modes of conveyance that can be employed upon the lakes"". Archibald McDonald of the Hudson's Bay Company wrote: ""I never heard of such a canoe being wrecked, or upset, or swamped ... they swam like ducks."" [29] The canot du nord (French: ""canoe of the north""), a craft specially made and adapted for speedy travel, was the workhorse of the fur trade transportation system. About one-half the size of the Montreal canoe, it could carry about 35 packs weighing 41 kg (90 lb) and was manned by four to eight men. It could be carried by two men and was portaged in the upright position. [29] The express canoe or canot léger, was about 4.6 m (15 ft) long and were used to carry people, reports, and news. Birch bark canoe making in Newfoundland, Canada The birch bark canoe was used in a 6,500-kilometre (4,000 mi) supply route from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean and the Mackenzie River , and continued to be used up to the end of the 19th century. [30] The indigenous peoples of eastern Canada and the northeast United States made canoes using the bark of the paper birch , which was harvested in early spring by stripping off the bark in one piece, using wooden wedges. Next, the two ends ( stem and stern ) were sewn together and made watertight with the pitch of balsam fir . The ribs of the canoe, called verons in Canadian French , were made of white cedar , and the hull, ribs, and thwarts were fastened using watap , a binding usually made from the roots of various species of conifers , such as the white spruce , black spruce , or cedar , and caulked with pitch . [31] [32] Skin canoes [ edit ] Skin canoes are constructed using animal skins stretched over a framework. Examples include the kayak and umiak . Modern canoes [ edit ] Stretching canvas on a canoe In 19th-century North America, the birch-on-frame construction technique evolved into the wood-and-canvas canoes made by fastening an external waterproofed canvas shell to planks and ribs by boat builders such as Old Town Canoe , E. M. White Canoe , Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company [33] in New Brunswick . While similar to bark canoes in the use of ribs , and a waterproof covering, the construction method is different, being built by bending ribs over a solid mold. Once removed from the mold, the decks, thwarts and seats are installed, and canvas is stretched tightly over the hull. The canvas is then treated with a combination of varnishes and paints to render it more durable and watertight . [34] Although canoes were once primarily a means of transport, with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft. John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books, and in 1866 founded the Royal Canoe Club in London and in 1880 the American Canoe Association . The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in 1900, and the British Canoe Union in 1936. Sprint canoe was a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the 1936 Berlin Olympics . [35] The International Canoe Federation was formed in 1946 and is the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide. Hull design [ edit ] 1 Bow , 2 Stern , 3 Hull , 4 Seat , 5 Thwart , 6 Gunwale , 7 Deck , 8 Yoke Prospector canoe showing rocker at the stern Hull design must meet different, often conflicting, requirements for speed, carrying capacity, maneuverability, and stability [36] The canoe's hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion . Length: this is often stated by manufacturers as the overall length of the boat , but what counts in performance terms is the length of the waterline , and more specifically its value relative to the displacement of the canoe. Displacement is the amount of water displaced by the boat. It is equal to the total weight of the boat and its contents since a floating body displaces its own weight in water. When a canoe is paddled through water, it takes an effort to push all of the displaced water out of the way. Canoes are displacement hulls : the longer the waterline relative to its displacement, the faster it can be paddled. Among general touring canoeists , 5.18 m (17 ft) is a popular length, providing a good compromise between capacity and cruising speed. [37] Too large a canoe will simply mean extra work paddling at cruising speed. Width (beam) : a wider boat provides more stability at the expense of speed. A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge, and a shorter boat needs a narrower beam to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water. [37] Canoe manufacturers typically provide three beam measurements: the gunwale (the measurement at the top of the hull), the waterline (the measurement at the point where the surface of the water meets the hull when it is empty), and the widest point. Another variation of the waterline beam measurement is called 4"" waterline where the displacement is taken into account. This measurement is done at the waterline level when the maximum load is applied to the canoe. [38] Some canoe races use the 4"" waterline beam measurement as the standard for their regulations. [39] In races, the measurement is done by measuring the widest point at 4 inches (10 cm) from the bottom of the canoe. [40] Freeboard : a higher-sided boat stays drier in rough water. The cost of high sides is extra weight, extra wind resistance [37] and increased susceptibility to cross-winds. Stability and immersed bottom shape: the hull can be optimized for initial stability (the boat feels steady when it sits flat on the water) or final stability (resistance to rolling and capsizing). A flatter-bottomed hull has higher initial stability, versus a rounder or V-shaped hull in cross-section has high final stability. [41] The fastest flat water non-racing canoes have sharp V-bottoms to cut through the water, but they are difficult to turn and have a deeper draft which makes them less suitable for shallows. Flat-bottomed canoes are most popular among recreational canoeists. At the cost of speed, they have a shallow draft, turn better, and more cargo space. The reason a flat bottom canoe has lower final stability is that the hull must wrap a sharper angle between the bottom and the sides, compared to a more round-bottomed boat. [37] Keel : an external keel makes a canoe track (hold its course) better and can stiffen a floppy bottom, but it can get stuck on rocks and decrease stability in rapids . [41] Profile, the shape of the canoe's sides. Sides that flare out above the waterline deflect water but require the paddler to reach out over the side of the canoe more. If the gunwale width is less than the maximum width the canoe is said to have tumblehome . Rocker: viewed from the side of the canoe, rocker is the amount of curve in the hull, much like the curve of a banana. The full length of the hull is in the water, so it tracks well and has good speed. As the rocker increases, so does the ease of turning, at the cost of tracking. [42] Some Native American birch-bark canoes were characterized by extreme rocker. [37] Hull symmetry : viewed from above, a symmetrical hull has its widest point at the center of the hull and both ends are identical. An asymmetrical hull typically has the widest section aft of centerline, creating a longer bow and improving speed. [42] Modern materials and construction [ edit ] Aluminum canoe Inflatable canoe at a canoe launch on the Charles River Plastic [ edit ] Royalex is a composite material , comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment. [43] As a canoe material, Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics such as polyethylene .  Royalex canoes are, however, more expensive than aluminium canoes or canoes made from traditionally molded or roto-molded polyethylene hulls. [43] It is heavier, and less suited for high-performance paddling than fiber-reinforced composites, such as fiberglass , kevlar , or graphite . Roto-molded polyethylene is a cheaper alternative to Royalex. Production of Royalex ceased in 2014. Folding canoes usually consist of a PVC skin around an aluminum frame. A Royalex Mad River Outrage canoe on the Hudson River in the Adirondack Park, New York State. Inflatable : These contain no rigid frame members and can be deflated, folded, and stored in a bag. The more durable types consist of an abrasion-resistant nylon or rubber outer shell, with separate PVC air chambers for the two side tubes and the floor. [44] Fiber reinforced composites [ edit ] Modern canoes are generally constructed by layering a fiber material inside a ""female"" mold. Fiberglass is the most common material used in manufacturing canoes. [45] Fiberglass is not expensive, can be molded to any shape, and is easy to repair. [37] Kevlar is popular with paddlers looking for a light, durable boat that will not be taken in whitewater. Fiberglass and Kevlar are strong but lack rigidity. Carbon fiber is used in racing canoes to create a very light, rigid construction usually combined with Kevlar for durability. Boats are built by draping the cloth in a mold, then impregnating it with a liquid resin . Optionally, a vacuum process can be used to remove excess resin to reduce weight. A gel coat on the outside gives a smoother appearance. [37] With stitch and glue , plywood panels are stitched together to form a hull shape, and the seams are reinforced with fiber reinforced composites and varnished. A cedar strip canoe is essentially a composite canoe with a cedar core. Usually fiberglass is used to reinforce the canoe since it is clear and allows a view of the cedar. Aluminum [ edit ] Before the invention of fiberglass, this was the standard choice for whitewater canoeing . It is good value and very strong by weight. [37] This material was once more popular but is being replaced by modern lighter materials. ""It is tough, durable, and will take being dragged over the bottom very well"", as it has no gel or polymer outer coating which would make it subject to abrasion.  The hull does not degrade from long term exposure to sunlight, and ""extremes of hot and cold do not affect the material"". It can dent, is difficult to repair, is noisy, can get stuck on underwater objects, and requires buoyancy chambers to assist in keeping the canoe afloat in a capsize. [46] In culture [ edit ] Henri Julien : La Chasse-galerie , oil painting 1906 In Canada, the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore, and is a symbol of Canadian identity . [47] From 1935 to 1986 the Canadian silver dollar depicted a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background. The Chasse-galerie is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a night of heavy drinking on New Year's Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues (about 400 km) away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil . Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe. One version of this fable ends with the coup de grâce when, still high in the sky, the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns, so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls. In John Steinbeck 's novella The Pearl set in Mexico, the main character's canoe is a means of making a living that has been passed down for generations and represents a link to cultural tradition. [48] The Māori , indigenous Polynesian people arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe (called waka ) voyages. Canoe traditions are important to the identity of Māori. Whakapapa (genealogical links) back to the crew of founding canoes served to establish the origins of tribes, and defined tribal boundaries and relationships. [49] Types [ edit ] Modern canoe types are usually categorized by the intended use. Many modern canoe designs are hybrids (a combination of two or more designs, meant for multiple uses). The purpose of the canoe will also often determine the materials used. Most canoes are designed for either one person (solo) or two people ( tandem ), but some are designed for more than two people. Women's C2 Sprint [ edit ] Main articles: Sprint canoe and Canoe sprint Sprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing. The paddler kneels on one knee, and uses a single-blade paddle . [50] Canoes have no rudder , so the boat must be steered by the athlete's paddle using a j-stroke . Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered. The minimum length of the opening on a C1 is 280 cm (110 in). Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam , which makes them very unstable.  A C4 can be up to 9 m (30 ft) long and weigh 30 kg (66 lb). [51] ICF classes include C1 (solo), C2 (crew of two), and C4 (crew of four). Race distances at the 2012 Olympic Games were 200 and 1000 meters. Slalom and wildwater [ edit ] Main articles: Canoe slalom and Wildwater canoeing Whitewater slalom canoe In ICF whitewater slalom paddlers negotiate their way down a 300 m (980 ft) of whitewater rapids , through a series of up to 25 gates (pairs of hanging poles). The colour of the poles indicates the direction in which the paddlers must pass through; time penalties are assessed for striking poles or missing gates. Categories are C1 (solo) and C2 (tandem), the latter for two men, and C2M (mixed) for one woman and one man. [52] C1 boats must have a minimum weight and width of 10 kg (22 lb) and 0.65 m (2 ft 2 in) and be not more than 3.5 m (11 ft) long. C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 15 kg (33 lb) and 0.75 m (2 ft 6 in), and be not more than 4.1 m (13 ft). Rudders are prohibited. Canoes are decked and propelled by single-bladed paddles, and the competitor must kneel. [53] In ICF wildwater canoeing athletes paddle a course of class III to IV whitewater (using the International Scale of River Difficulty ), passing over waves, holes and rocks of a natural riverbed in events lasting either 20–30 minutes (""Classic"" races) or 2–3 minutes (""Sprint"" races). Categories are C1 and C2, for both women and men. C1s must have a minimum weight and width of 12 kg (26 lb) and 0.7 m (2 ft 4 in), and a maximum length of 4.3 m (14 ft). C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 18 kg (40 lb) and 0.8 metres (2 ft 7 in), and a maximum length of 5 metres (16 ft). Rudders are prohibited. The canoes are decked boats which must be propelled by single bladed paddles and inside which the paddler kneels. [54] Marathon [ edit ] Main article: Canoe marathon Marathons are long-distance races which may include portages . Under ICF rules minimum canoe weight is 10 and 14 kg (22 and 31 lb) for C1 and C2 respectively. Other rules can vary by race, for example in the Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie athletes race in C2s, with a maximum length of 5.6 m (18 ft 6 in), minimum width of 69 cm (27 in) at 8 cm (3 in) from the bottom of the centre of the craft, minimum height of 38 cm (15 in) at the bow and 25 cm (10 in) at the centre and stern. [55] The Texas Water Safari , at 422 km (262 mi), includes an open class, the only rule being the vessel must be human-powered , and although novel setups have been tried, the fastest so far has been the six-man canoe. [56] Touring [ edit ] See also: Canoe camping A ""touring"" or ""tripping"" canoe is a boat for traveling on lakes and or rivers with capacity for camping gear. Tripping canoes such as the Chestnut Prospector and Old Town Tripper derivates are touring canoes for wilderness trips. They are typically made of heavier and tougher materials and designed with the ability to carry large amounts of gear while being maneuverable enough for rivers with some whitewater . Prospector is now a generic name for derivates of the Chestnut model, a popular type of wilderness tripping canoe marked by a shallow arch hull with a relatively large amount of rocker, giving a nice balance for wilderness tripping over lakes and rivers with some rapids . A touring canoe is sometimes covered with a greatly extended deck, forming a ""cockpit"" for the paddlers. A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwales can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily. Freestyle [ edit ] Playboating decked canoe A canoe specialized for whitewater play and tricks. Most are identical to short, flat-bottomed kayak playboats except for internal outfitting. The paddler kneels and uses a single-blade canoe paddle. Playboating is a discipline of whitewater canoeing where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot), as opposed to downriver where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river (although whitewater canoeists will often stop and play en route). Specialized canoes known as playboats can be used. Square-stern canoe [ edit ] A square-stern canoe is an asymmetrical canoe with a squared-off stern for the mounting of an outboard motor , and is meant for lake travel or fishing.  Since mounting a rudder on the square stern is very easy, such canoes often are adapted for sailing . Canoe launches [ edit ] A canoe launch is a place for launching canoes, similar to a boat launch which is often for launching larger watercraft. Canoe launches are frequently on river banks or beaches . Canoe launches may be designated on maps of places such as parks or nature reserves .

Sep 25, 2019 at 11:26am ET Gary Lieber By : Gary Lieber Canoo, a new BEV startup, revealed its products and strategy yesterday in Torrance California.  The company intends to market a subscription-based compact mini-van sized BEV or as Canoo describes its vehicle as an “Urban Loft on wheels” starting in 2021. Founded in 2017 by ex- BMW and Über BEV executives, Canoo hopes to take the BEV to a new level with a subscription-based direct-sales model to customers. The subscription is envisioned as a month-to-month model that include services such as registration, maintenance, insurance management and charging. More Subscription Cars Canoo’s global headquartered is in Los Angeles, and currently has approximately 400 employees. The company’s global headquarters is located in a 90,000 square foot building in Torrance, California which also houses the R&D facility and design studio. The company has been based there since May 21, 2018. The company also has an office in Silicon Valley, a Chinese headquarter in Shanghai, and will utilize contract manufacturing and support partners. “We believe that the potential of EV architecture can enable a post-SUV era that addresses the ever-growing desire for space and value,” said Ulrich Kranz, In Charge at Canoo. “We promised a truly different approach for EVs, and our Canoo proves that we can deliver on that vision. The unveiling also kicks off the period of beta testing, meaning we are on track for our launch date in 2021. We are very proud of the team. In my 30 years' experience, I have never seen so many quality achievements in such a short time.” The Canoo vehicles will be built on a proprietary “skateboard” architecture, directly housing the batteries and electric drivetrain. All of Canoo’s vehicles will share the same underpinning and different cabins or “top hats” can be married on top to create unique vehicles. Leveraging the same fixed and flat skateboard allows for reduced research and development costs, efficient production and better use of interior space. The Canoo is initially expected to have an EPA range of 250-300 miles. The battery and skateboard are an integrated design, and like other skateboard BEV systems, it is designed to accept other types of bodies or “top hats” for different vehicle designs. The Canoo vehicles are described as “autonomous-ready” with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and driver monitoring systems including five radars and 12 ultrasonic systems for Level 2+ autonomous capabilities. The Canoo will integrate these systems with an industry-first steer-by-wire system with no mechanical connections between the steering wheel and wheels. Canoo says that their vehicle design is currently completing validation testing with beta fleet testing in starting in October 2019 with a goal of first subscriber customers in 2021. Canoo will be unveiling its vehicle to the public at two southern California events The Abbot Kinney Festival in Venice, California, on September 29 and The Car Classic at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California on October 20. While the Canoo design and business model is appealing to today’s millennial, the proof will be in the difficult task of bringing the business and product to market.  The details are sketchy at this time, but we will be following this story as it develops. Gallery: Canoo EV 31 Photos Canoo Fact Sheet: Canoo Company Overview COMPANY & MISSION Canoo is a Los Angeles based company creating electric vehicles (EV) for subscription only. The first vehicle Canoo is unveiling will launch in 2021 and was designed for a world in which transportation is becoming increasingly electric, shared and autonomous. Electric – Canoo makes unique EVs affordable for inhabitants in cities world-wide. Shared – Canoo’s first vehicle capitalizes on the EV architecture in a way that provides more interior space – making ridesharing even more comfortable. Autonomous – Canoo will be class-competitive regarding autonomous driving and will feature a Level 2+ system. The car is prepared for full autonomy as technology evolves. APPROACH & USPs Canoo is challenging the traditional way of building, using and offering vehicles based on a threefold approach: A new business model that focuses on reducing production and infrastructure costs to make EVs more affordable to customers. A fresh design capitalizing on the space EVs provide, looking like nothing on the road today and challenging the norms of space and function. The unique design points to the future of cars that are electric and autonomous. A subscription model that puts an end to ownership, providing a hassle- and commitment-free car experience in modern cities. THE TEAM Canoo was founded in December 2017 by a group of experienced automotive executives and engineers. The team has since been commended by various experts from successful tech and car companies. Today, Canoo has grown to around 400 team members—covering the entire value chain, bringing together a unique EV with a unique business model for a unique User experience. THE PURPOSE Canoo frees its subscribers from the hassle and commitment of car ownership, saves them time and enables a more efficient way to use a car. By providing an attractive EV at an affordable price via its subscription model, Canoo can reduce carbon emissions and increase the usage of cars. UNIQUE PRODUCT DESIGN There is no need for electric vehicles to look like traditional cars, yet today they still do. Canoo plans to change that. By leveraging the benefits of a flat EV platform, Canoo can create unique vehicles that look nothing like what is on the road today. Canoo’s vehicles will move away from traditional three box car design, which have separate compartments for the engine, passengers and luggage. Instead, the Company is embracing a minimalist design that maximizes interior space. Canoo’s first vehicle will have the exterior footprint of a compact car, with the interior space of a large SUV. LEAN USER INTERFACE Traditional car makers have an outdated approach that is focused on proprietary infotainment systems and overwhelming screens, but most customers just want to use the very same services they are used to having on their phones when inside the vehicle. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Canoo is developing a lean user interface that easily connects with the user’s own existing digital life. NEXT-GENERATION BUSINESS MODEL Building electric vehicles is expensive, therefore, Canoo is rethinking the traditional automotive business model. Canoo’s cost structure is very lean. The company is focused on lowering costs and generating higher revenue through: VEHICLE ARCHITECTURE Canoo is developing a “skateboard” architecture, which will house a battery and electric drivetrain that can achieve up to 300 miles of range. All of Canoo’s vehicles will share the same underpinning. Different cabins or “top hats” will be married on top to create the four unique vehicles. Leveraging the same fixed and flat skateboard allows for reduced R&D costs, efficient production and a better use of interior space. The skateboard houses the most expensive components of the vehicle and is designed in a way that most crash testing does not need to be repeated per vehicle, reducing the vehicle’s development cycle timeline and costs. LIFECYCLE & DEPRECIATION Electric powertrains inherently have a long, low-maintenance life. This, combined with the fact that Canoo won’t sell its vehicles, allows the company to depreciate the assets over a longer period of time compared to traditional car companies. The benefit is a lower monthly subscription cost for subscribers. The company will take cues from the airline industry and refurbish the vehicles to keep them up to date over their lifecycle. CONTRACT MANUFACTURING Canoo is asset-lean. The company will use contract manufacturing to outsource production. PARTNERSHIP APPROACH For areas like autonomous driving that require very specialized expertise, Canoo is working with leaders in many fields to integrate the latest technologies into the vehicles to offer the best possible product experience to its subscribers. DIRECT TO CONSUMER Canoo will not have a physical sales network. The company will offer its product directly to customers. SUBSCRIPTION Canoo believes that there is a better solution than traditional car ownership. Instead, Canoo will free its customers from the burden of ownership by offering a hassle- and commitment-free EV subscription for one monthly, affordable price and with no set end date. The subscription may include services such as registration, maintenance, insurance management and charging—all from a single app. Canoo brings the convenience and affordability of the well -known month-to-month subscription model to the car industry, providing consumers with the convenience and value they deserve. Company Facts COMPANY FOUNDING The company started in December 2017. LAUNCH PLANS Canoo will launch its first vehicle in Los Angeles, CA, starting in 2021.
