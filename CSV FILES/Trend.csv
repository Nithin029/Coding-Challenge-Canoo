The growth in electric car sales took place in the context of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022 dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales – including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) – exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021. 2 This figure – 10 million EV sales worldwide – exceeds the total number of cars sold across the entire European Union (about 9.5 million vehicles) and is nearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. In the course of just five years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow from 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. The share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017. Over 26 million electric cars were on the road in 2022, up 60% relative to 2021 and more than 5 times the stock in 2018 Increasing sales pushed the total number of electric cars on the world’s roads to 26 million, up 60% relative to 2021, with BEVs accounting for over 70% of total annual growth, as in previous years. As a result, about 70% of the global stock of electric cars in 2022 were BEVs. The increase in sales from 2021 to 2022 was just as high as from 2020 to 2021 in absolute terms – up 3.5 million – but relative growth was lower (sales doubled from 2020 to 2021). The exceptional boom in 2021 may be explained by EV markets catching up in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Seen in comparison to recent years, the annual growth rate for electric car sales in 2022 was similar to the average rate over 2015-2018, and the annual growth rate for the global stock of electric cars in 2022 was similar to that of 2021 and over the 2015-2018 period, showing a robust recovery of EV market expansion to pre-pandemic pace. Global electric car stock, 2010-2022 Open expand Half of the world’s electric cars are in China The increase in electric car sales varied across regions and powertrains, but remains dominated by the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). In 2022, BEV sales in China increased by 60% relative to 2021 to reach 4.4 million, and PHEV sales nearly tripled to 1.5 million. The faster growth in PHEV sales relative to BEVs warrants further examination in the coming years, as PHEV sales still remain lower overall and could be catching up on the post-Covid-19 boom only now; BEV sales in China tripled from 2020 to 2021 after moderate growth over 2018-2020. Electric car sales increased even while total car sales dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021. China accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car registrations globally. For the first time in 2022, China accounted for more than 50% of all the electric cars on the world’s roads, a total of 13.8 million. This strong growth results from more than a decade of sustained policy support for early adopters, including an extension of purchase incentives initially planned for phase-out in 2020 to the end of 2022 due to Covid-19, in addition to non-financial support such as rapid roll-out of charging infrastructure and stringent registration policies for non-electric cars. In 2022, the share of electric cars in total domestic car sales reached 29% in China, up from 16% in 2021 and under 6% between 2018 and 2020. China has therefore achieved its 2025 national target of a 20% sales share for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) 3 well in advance. All indicators point to further growth: although the national NEV sales target is yet to be updated by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which is responsible for the automotive industry, the objective of greater road transport electrification is re-affirmed in multiple strategy documents. China aims to reach a 50% sales share by 2030 in so-called “key air pollution control regions”, and 40% across the country by 2030 to support the national action plan for carbon peaking. If recent market trends continue, China’s 2030 targets may also be reached ahead of time. Provincial governments are also supporting adoption of NEVs, with 18 provinces to date having set NEV targets. Support at the regional level in China has also helped to advance some of the world’s largest EV makers. Shenzhen-based BYD has supplied most of the city’s electric buses and taxis, and its leading position is also reflected in Shenzhen’s ambition of reaching a 60% NEV sales share by 2025. Guangzhou, which has a 50% NEV sales share by 2025 target, facilitated the expansion of Xpeng Motors to become one of the national EV frontrunners. Monthly new electric car registrations in China, 2020-2023 Open expand Whether China’s electric car sales share will remain significantly above the 20% target in 2023 remains uncertain, as sales may have been especially high in anticipation of incentives being phased out at the end of 2022. Sales in January 2023 plunged , and while this is in part due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, they were nearly 10% lower than sales in January 2022. However, electric car sales caught up in February and March 2023, standing nearly 60% above sales in February 2022 and more than 25% above sales in March 2022, thereby bringing sales in the first quarter of 2023 more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022. Growth remained steady in Europe despite disruptions In Europe, 4 electric car sales increased by more than 15% in 2022 relative to 2021 to reach 2.7 million. Sales grew more quickly in previous years: annual growth stood at more than 65% in 2021 and averaged 40% over 2017-2019. In 2022, BEV sales rose by 30% relative to 2021 (compared to 65% growth in 2021 relative to 2020) while PHEV sales dipped by around 3%. Europe accounted for 10% of global growth in new electric car sales. Despite slower growth in 2022, electric car sales are still increasing in Europe in the context of continued contraction in car markets: total car sales in Europe dipped by 3% in 2022 relative to 2021. The slowdown seen in Europe relative to previous years was, in part, a reflection of the exceptional growth in electric car sales that took place in 2020 and 2021 in the European Union, as manufacturers quickly adjusted corporate strategy to comply with the CO 2 emission standards passed in 2019. These standards covered the 2020-2024 period, with EU-wide emission targets becoming stricter only from 2025 and 2030 onwards. High energy prices in 2022 had a mixed impact on the competitiveness of EVs relative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Gasoline and diesel prices for ICE cars spiked, but residential electricity tariffs (with relevance for charging) also increased in some cases. Higher electricity and gas prices also increased manufacturing costs for both ICE and EV cars, with some carmakers arguing that high energy prices could restrict future investment for new battery manufacturing capacity. Europe remained the world’s second largest market for electric cars after China in 2022, accounting for 25% of all electric car sales and 30% of the global stock. The sales share of electric cars reached 21%, up from 18% in 2021, 10% in 2020 and under 3% prior to 2019. European countries continued to rank highly for the sales share of electric cars, led by Norway at 88%, Sweden at 54%, the Netherlands at 35%, Germany at 31%, the United Kingdom at 23% and France at 21% in 2022. In volume terms, Germany is the biggest market in Europe with sales of 830 000 in 2022, followed by the United Kingdom with 370 000 and France with 330 000. Sales also exceeded 80 000 in Spain. The share of electric cars in total car sales has increased tenfold in Germany since before the Covid-19 pandemic, which can in part be explained by increasing support post-pandemic, such as purchase incentives through the Umweltbonus , and a frontloading of sales in 2022 in expectation of subsidies being further reduced from 2023 onwards. However, in Italy, electric car sales decreased from 140 000 in 2021 to 115 000 in 2022, and they also decreased or stagnated in Austria, Denmark and Finland. Electric car registrations and sales share in selected European countries, 2018-2022 Open expand Electric car registrations and sales share in China, United States and Europe, 2018-2022 Open expand Electric car registrations and sales share in selected countries, 2018-2022 Open expand Sales are expected to continue increasing in Europe, especially following recent policy developments under the ‘Fit for 55’ package. New rules set stricter CO 2 emission standards for 2030-2034 and target a 100% reduction in CO 2 emissions for new cars and vans from 2035 relative to 2021 levels. In the nearer term, an incentive mechanism operating between 2025 and 2029 will reward manufacturers that achieve a 25% car sales share of zero- and low-emission cars (17% for vans). In the first two months of 2023, battery electric car sales were already up by over 30% year-on-year, while overall car sales increased by just over 10% year-on-year. The United States confirms return to growth In the United States, electric car sales increased 55% in 2022 relative to 2021, led by BEVs. Sales of BEVs increased by 70%, reaching nearly 800 000 and confirming a second consecutive year of strong growth after the 2019-2020 dip. Sales of PHEVs also grew, albeit by only 15%. The increase in electric car sales was particularly high in the United States, considering that total car sales dropped by 8% in 2022 relative to 2021, a much sharper decrease than the global average (minus 3%). Overall, the United States accounted for 10% of the global growth in sales. The total stock of electric cars reached 3 million, up 40% relative to 2021 and accounting for 10% of the global total. The share of electric cars in total car sales reached nearly 8%, up from just above 5% in 2021 and around 2% between 2018 and 2020. A number of factors are helping to increase sales in the United States. A greater number of available models, beyond those offered by Tesla, the historic leader, helped to close the supply gap. Given that major companies like Tesla and General Motors had already reached their subsidy cap under US support in previous years, 5 new models from other companies being available means that more consumers can benefit from purchase incentives, which can be as high as USD 7 500. Awareness is increasing as government and companies lean towards electrification: in 2022, a quarter of Americans expect that their next car will be electric, according to the American Automobile Association. Although charging infrastructure and driving range have improved over the years, they remain major concerns for US drivers given the typically long travel distances and lower popularity and limited availability of alternatives such as rail. However, in 2021 the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law strengthened support for EV charging, allocating USD 5 billion in total funding over the 2022-2026 period through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, as well as USD 2.5 billion in competitive grants over the same period through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program. Monthly new electric car registrations in the United States, 2020-2023 Open expand The acceleration in sales growth could continue in 2023 and beyond thanks to recent new policy support (see Prospects for electric vehicle deployment ). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has triggered a rush by global electromobility companies to expand US manufacturing operations. Between August 2022 and March 2023, major EV and battery makers announced cumulative post-IRA investments of USD 52 billion in North American EV supply chains, of which 50% is for battery manufacturing, and about 20% each for battery components and EV manufacturing. Overall, company announcements including tentative commitments for US investments for future battery and EV production add up to around USD 75-108 billion . As an example, Tesla plans to relocate its Berlin-based lithium-ion battery gigafactory to Texas, where it will work in partnership with China’s CATL, and to manufacture next-generation EVs in Mexico . Ford also announced a deal with CATL for a battery plant in Michigan, and plans to increase electric car manufacturing sixfold by the end of 2023 relative to 2022, at 600 000 vehicles per year, scaling up to 2 million by 2026. BMW is seeking to expand EV manufacturing at its plant in South Carolina following the IRA. Volkswagen chose Canada for its first battery plant outside Europe , which will begin operations in 2027, and is also investing USD 2 billion in its plant in South Carolina. While these investments can be expected to lead to high growth in the years to come, the impact may only fully be seen from 2024 onwards as plants come online. In the immediate term, the IRA has constrained eligibility requirements for purchase incentives, as vehicles need to be produced in North America in order to qualify for a subsidy. However, electric car sales have remained strong since August 2022, and the first months of 2023 have been no exception: In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales increased 60% compared to the same period in 2022, potentially boosted by the January 2023 removal of the subsidy caps for manufacturers, which means models by market leaders can now benefit from purchase incentives. In the longer-term, the list of models eligible for subsidies is expected to expand. The 2023 outlook for electric cars is bright Early indications from first quarter sales of 2023 point to an upbeat market, supported by cost declines as well as strengthened policy support in key markets such as the United States. Globally, our current estimate is therefore for nearly 14 million electric cars to be sold in 2023, building on the more than 2.3 million already sold in the first quarter of the year. This represents a 35% increase in electric car sales in 2023 compared to 2022 and would bring the global electric sales share to around 18%, up from 14% in 2022. Electric car sales in the first three months of 2023 have shown strong signs of growth compared to the same period in 2022. In the United States, more than 320 000 electric cars were sold in the first quarter of 2023, 60% more than over the same period in 2022. Our current expectation is for this growth to be sustained throughout the year, with electric car sales reaching over 1.5 million in 2023, bringing the electric car sales share in the United States up to around 12% in 2023. In China, electric car sales were off to a rough start in 2023, with January sales being 8% lower than in January 2022. The latest available data suggests a quick recovery: over the entire first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in China were more than 20% higher than in the first quarter of 2022, with more than 1.3 million electric cars being registered. For the remainder of 2023, we expect the generally favourable cost structure of electric cars to outweigh the effects of the phase-out of the NEV subsidy. As a result, our current expectation is for electric car sales in China to be more than 30% higher than in 2022 and reach around 8 million by the end of 2023, reaching a sales share of over 35% (from 29% in 2022). Based on recent trends and tightening CO 2 targets not going into effect until 2025, the growth of electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. In the first quarter of 2023, electric car sales in Europe increased by around 10% compared to the same period in 2022. For the full year, we currently expect electric car sales to increase by over 25%, with one-in-four cars sold in Europe being electric. Outside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to reach around 900 000 in 2023 – 50% higher than in 2022. Electric car sales in India in the first quarter of 2023 are already double what they were in the same period in 2022. In India and across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent 2-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing share. There are, of course, downside risks to the 2023 outlook: a sluggish global economy and the phase-out of subsidies for NEVs in China could reduce 2023 growth in global electric car sales. On the upside, new markets may open up more quickly than anticipated, as persistent high oil prices make the case for EVs stronger in an increasing number of settings. And new policy developments, such as the April 2023 proposal from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen GHG emissions standards for cars, may send signals that boost sales even before going into effect. Electric car models The number of electric car models rises, especially for large cars and SUVs, at the same time as it decreases for conventional cars The race to electrification is increasing the number of electric car models available on the market. In 2022, the number of available options reached 500, up from below 450 in 2021 and more than doubling relative to 2018-2019. As in previous years, China has the broadest portfolio with nearly 300 available models, double the number available in 2018-2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This remains nearly twice as many as in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom, which all have around 150 models available, more than three times as many as before the pandemic. In the United States, there were fewer than 100 models available in 2022, but twice as many as before the pandemic; and 30 or fewer were available in Canada, Japan and Korea. Breakdown of available cars by powertrain and segment, 2022 Open expand The 2022 trend reflects the increasing maturity of EV markets and demonstrates that carmakers are responding to increasing consumer demand for electric cars. However, the number of electric car models available remains much lower than that of conventional ICE cars, which has remained above 1 250 since 2010 and peaked at 1 500 in the middle of the past decade. In recent years, the number of ICE models sold has been steadily decreasing , at a compound annual growth rate of minus 2% over the 2016-2022 period, reaching about 1 300 models in 2022. This dip varies across major car markets and is most pronounced in China, where the number of available ICE options was 8% lower in 2022 than in 2016, versus 3-4% lower in the United States and Europe over the same period. This could result from contracting car markets and a progressive shift towards EVs among major carmakers. Looking forward, the total number of ICE models available could remain stable, while the number of new models shrinks, if carmakers focus on electrification and keep selling existing ICE options rather than increasing budgets to develop new models. In contrast to ICE models, EV model availability has been growing quickly, at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the 2016-2022 period. Such growth is to be expected in a nascent market with a large number of new entrants bringing innovative products to the market, and as incumbents diversify their portfolios. Growth has been slightly lower in recent years: the annual growth rate stood at around 25% in 2021 and 15% in 2022. In the future, the number of models can be expected to continue to increase quickly, as major carmakers expand their EV portfolios and new entrants strengthen their positions, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The historic number of ICE models available on the market suggests that the current number of EV options could double, at least, before stabilising. Electric car model availability in selected countries by size, 2018-2022 Open expand SUVs and large car models dominate both EV and ICE markets A major concern for global car markets – both EV and ICE – is the overwhelming dominance of SUVs and large models among available options. Carmakers are able to generate higher revenues from such models, given higher profit margins, which can cover some of the investments made in developing electric options. In certain cases, such as in the United States, larger vehicles can also benefit from less stringent fuel economy standards, hence creating an incentive for carmakers to slightly increase the vehicle size of a car for it to qualify as a light truck. However, large models are more expensive, which poses significant affordability issues across the board, and all the more so in EMDEs. Large models also have implications for sustainability and supply chains, being equipped with larger batteries that require more critical minerals. In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size of small battery electric cars ranged from 25 kWh in China to 35 kWh across France, Germany and the United Kingdom, and about 60 kWh in the United States. In comparison, the average for battery electric SUVs was around 70-75 kWh in these countries, and within the 75-90 kWh range for large car models. Transitioning from ICE to electric is a priority for achieving net zero emissions targets, regardless of vehicle size, but mitigating the impacts of higher battery sizes will also be important. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2022, the sales-weighted average weight of a battery electric SUV was 1.5 times higher than the average small battery electric car, requiring greater amounts of steel, aluminium and plastic; the battery in the SUV was twice as large, requiring about 75% more critical minerals. The CO 2 emissions associated with materials processing, manufacturing and assembly can be estimated at more than 70% higher as a result. At the same time, in 2022, electric SUVs resulted in the displacement of over 150 000 barrels per day of oil consumption and avoided the associated tailpipe emissions that would have been generated through burning the fuel in combustion engines. Although electric SUVs represented roughly 35% of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) in 2022, their share of oil displacement was even higher (about 40%), as SUVs tend to be driven more than smaller cars. Of course, smaller vehicles generally require less energy to operate and less materials to build, but electric SUVs certainly remain favourable to ICE vehicles. In 2022, ICE SUVs emitted more than 1 Gt CO 2 , far greater than the 80 Mt net emissions reductions from the electric vehicle fleet that year. While total car sales decreased by 0.5% in 2022, SUV sales increased by 3% relative to 2021, accounting for about 45% of total car sales, with noticeable growth in the United States, India and Europe. Of the 1 300 available options for ICE cars in 2022, more than 40% were SUVs, compared to fewer than 35% for small and medium cars. The total number of available ICE options went down from 2016 to 2022, but the drop was only for small and medium cars (down 35%) while large cars and SUVs increased (up 10%). Similar trends are observed in EV markets. Around 16% of all SUVs sold were electric in 2022, which is above the overall market share of EVs and demonstrates consumer preferences for SUVs regardless of whether they are an ICE vehicle or EV. Nearly 40% of all BEV models available in 2022 were SUVs, which is equivalent to the shares of small and medium car options combined. Other large models accounted for more than 15%. Just 3 years before, in 2019, small and medium models accounted for 60% of all available models, and SUVs just 30%. In China and Europe, SUVs and large models accounted for 60% of available BEV options in 2022, on par with the world average. As a comparison, ICE SUVs and large models accounted for about 70% of available ICE options in these regions, suggesting that electric cars currently remain somewhat smaller than their ICE equivalents. Announcements by some major European carmakers indicate that there could be a greater focus on smaller, more popular models in the years to come. For example, Volkswagen has announced the launch of a compact model for the European market under EUR 25 000 by 2025 and under EUR 20 000 by 2026-2027, as a means to appeal to a broader consumer base. In the United States, over 80% of available BEV options in 2022 were SUVs or large car models, which is greater than the share of ICE SUVs or large models at 70%. Looking ahead, more electric SUVs are to be expected in the United States, should recent policy announcements on expansion of IRA incentives to more SUVs be implemented. Following the IRA, the US Treasury has been revising vehicle classifications, and in 2023 changed the eligibility criteria for clean vehicle credits relevant to smaller SUVs, which are now eligible if priced under USD 80 000, up from the previous limit of USD 55 000. Electric cars remain much cheaper in China The growth in electric car sales in China has been underpinned by sustained policy support, but also cheaper retail prices. In 2022, the sales-weighted average price of a small BEV in China was below USD 10 000. This is significantly less than the prices of small BEVs found in Europe and the United States, where the sales-weighted average price exceeded USD 30 000 in the same year. In China, the best-selling electric cars in 2022 were the Wuling Mini BEV, a small model priced at under USD 6 500, and BYD’s Dolphin, another small model, below USD 16 000. Together, these two models accounted for nearly 15% of Chinese BEV passenger car sales, illustrating the appetite for smaller models. To compare, the best-selling small BEVs across France, Germany and the United Kingdom – Fiat’s 500, Peugeot’s e-208 and Renault’s Zoe – were all priced above USD 35 000. Few small BEVs were sold in the United States, limited mainly to Chevrolet’s Bolt and the Mini Cooper BEV, which are priced around USD 30 000. Tesla’s Y Model was the best-selling BEV passenger car in both the selected European countries (priced at more than USD 65 000) and the United States (more than USD 50 000). 6 Chinese carmakers have focused on developing smaller and more affordable models in advance of their international peers, cutting down costs following years of tough competition domestically. Hundreds of small EV manufacturers have entered the market since the 2000s, benefitting from a variety of public support schemes, including subsidies and incentives for both consumers and manufacturers. The majority of these firms went bankrupt due to competition as subsidies were gradually phased out, and the market has since consolidated around a dozen frontrunners, which have succeeded in developing small and cheap electric cars for the Chinese market. Vertical integration of battery and EV supply chains from mineral processing to battery and EV manufacturing, as well as cheaper labour, manufacturing and access to finance across the board, have also contributed to developing cheaper models. Meanwhile, carmakers in Europe and the United States – both early developers such as Tesla and incumbent major manufacturers – have mostly focused on larger or more luxurious models to date, hence offering few options affordable for mass-market consumers. However, the small options available in these countries typically offer greater performance than those in China, such as longer driving range. In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China. For other segments, the differences are less significant. The broader availability of public charging points in China may, in part, explain why consumers there have been more willing to opt for lower driving ranges than their European or American counterparts. In 2022, Tesla heavily reduced the price of its models on two occasions as competition increased, and many carmakers have also announced cheaper options in the coming years. While these announcements warrant further examination, this trend could indicate that the price gap between small electric cars and incumbent ICE options could progressively close during this decade. Emerging markets Emerging markets see encouraging growth China, Europe and the United States – the three major markets for electric cars – accounted for about 95% of global sales in 2022. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) outside China account for only a fraction of the global electric car market. Demand for electric cars has increased in recent years, but sales remain low. While EMDEs often quickly adopt low-cost emerging technology products (e.g. smartphones, computers and connected devices), electric cars remain typically too expensive for the majority of the population. According to a recent survey , over 50% of Ghanaian respondents would prefer to purchase an EV to an ICE vehicle, but more than half of those potential consumers would not be willing to spend more than USD 20 000 for an electric car. Lack of access to reliable and affordable charging can be a barrier, as can limited access to EV servicing, maintenance and repair. In most EMDEs, road transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, which have seen much greater success in terms of electrification, as well as shared mobility for regional commutes. Purchasing behaviour is also different, with lower personal car ownership rates and more common purchase of used cars. Looking forward, while sales of electric cars – both new and used – can be expected to increase in EMDEs, it is likely that many countries will continue to rely primarily on two- and three-wheelers (see subsequent section on these vehicles in this report). There was a notable boom in electromobility in 2022 in India, Thailand and Indonesia. Collectively, sales of electric cars in these countries more than tripled relative to 2021, reaching nearly 80 000. Sales in 2022 were 7 times higher than in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. In contrast, sales in other EMDEs were lower. In India, BEV sales reached nearly 50 000 in 2022, 4 times more than in 2021, while total car sales increased by just below 15%. Leading domestic manufacturer Tata accounted for over 85% of BEV sales, including through sales of its small BEV Tigor/Tiago, which quadrupled. Indian PHEV sales remained close to zero. Burgeoning electromobility companies are now betting on the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme – with around USD 2 billion in subsidy programmes – to ramp up EV and component manufacturing. This scheme has attracted investments totalling USD 8.3 billion. The Indian market, however, currently remains geared towards shared and smaller mobility. In 2022, 25% of electric car purchases in India were by fleet operators, such as for taxis. In early 2023, Tata secured a large order from Uber for 25 000 electric cars. Furthermore, while 55% of three-wheelers sold were electric, fewer than 2% of cars sold were EVs. Ola , India’s top EV company by revenue, does not yet offer electric cars. Ola is instead concentrating on smaller mobility and aims to double its electric two-wheeler manufacturing capacity to 2 million by the end of 2023, and to reach an annual production capacity of 10 million between 2025 and 2028. The company also seeks to build lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities, initially at 5 GWh capacity, scaling up to 100 GWh by 2030. Ola aims to start marketing electric cars for its taxi business by 2024 and to make its fleet of taxis fully electric by 2029, while launching its own electric car business for both the high-end and mass markets. It announced over USD 900 million of investments for battery and EV manufacturing in Southern India, and an increase in annual production from 100 000 to 140 000 vehicles. Electric car sales by powertrain and available models by car size in selected regions, 2018-2022 Open expand Electric car sales by powertrain and available models by car size in selected countries, 2018-2022 Open expand In Thailand, electric car sales doubled to 21 000, equally distributed between BEVs and PHEVs. The emerging presence of Chinese carmakers has accelerated EV adoption in the country. In 2021, Chinese original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Great Wall Motors launched its Ora Good Cat BEV model in the Thai market, and in 2022 it became the most sold electric car in Thailand, with nearly 4 000 sales. The second and third best-selling cars were also Chinese, manufactured by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), none of which were sold in the country in 2020. Chinese automakers were able to undercut EV prices from foreign competitors also present in the Thai market, such as BMW and Mercedes, thereby appealing to a broader consumer base. In addition, the Thai government offers various financial incentives for electric cars, including subsidies, excise duty waivers and import tax reductions, which have contributed to making electric cars more attractive. Tesla is planning to enter the Thai market in 2023 along with building Superchargers. In Indonesia, BEV sales multiplied by more than 14, exceeding 10 000, while PHEV sales remained close to zero. In March 2023, Indonesia announced new incentives to support sales of electric two-wheelers, cars and buses, with the aim of strengthening domestic capacity in EV and battery manufacturing through local component requirements. The government aims to subsidise the sale of 200 000 electric two-wheelers and 36 000 electric cars in 2023, reaching a sales share of 4% and 5% respectively. The new subsidies could reduce the price of an electric two-wheeler by 25-50% to help compete against ICE equivalents. Indonesia plays an important role in EV and battery supply chains, in particular given its abundant raw mineral resources and status as the world’s largest nickel miner. This has attracted investment from global companies, and Indonesia could become the largest manufacturing hub in the region for batteries and components. Model availability remains an issue in EMDEs, with many of the options on sale heavily geared towards the higher end, such as SUVs, large and luxury models. While the trend for SUVs is global, purchasing power is more limited in EMDEs, making such vehicles largely unaffordable. Across the different regions considered in this section of the report, for a total of more than 60 EMDEs, including those which receive support from the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Global E-Mobility Programme, there were two to six times more large models available than small ones in 2022. In Africa, the best-selling electric car model in 2022 was the Hyundai Kona, a crossover BEV, and there were about as many recorded sales of Porsche’s large and expensive Taycan BEV as there were of Nissan’s medium-sized Leaf BEV. There were also eight times more sales of electric SUVs than of the Mini Cooper SE BEV and Renault Zoe BEV combined, the two best-selling small electric cars. In India, the best-selling electric car model was Tata’s crossover Nexon BEV, with over 32 000 sales, or three times more than the second best-selling model, Tata’s small Tigor/Tiago BEV. Across all of the EMDEs considered here, sales of electric SUVs reached 45 000, which is more than the sales of small (23 000) and medium (16 000) electric cars combined. In Costa Rica, the leading country in Latin America in terms of BEV sales share, only 4 models in the top 20 were not SUVs, and nearly a third were luxury models. The future of mass-market electrification in EMDEs relies on the development of smaller, more affordable electric cars, alongside two- and three-wheelers. On the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle sales An important distinction for assessing the evolution of vehicle markets is the difference between registrations and sales. New registrations represent the number of vehicles that have been officially registered for the first time with the relevant government ministry or insurance agency, including domestically produced and imported vehicles. Sales can either refer to vehicles sold by dealers or agencies (retail sales), or to vehicles sold to dealers by vehicle manufacturers (factory shipments, i.e. including exports). The choice of metric can make a significant difference when analysing vehicle markets. For consistency in accounting across all countries, and to avoid double-counting at a global level, in this report vehicle market sizes are based on new vehicle registrations, where available, and retail sales otherwise, not on factory shipments. China’s vehicle market trends in 2022 are a good illustration of why this matters. In 2022, an increase of 7 to 10% in factory shipments (reported as sales) for the Chinese passenger car market was reported, while insurance registrations showed a stagnation of the domestic market in the same year. This increase was observed in data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), which is the official data source for China’s car industry. CAAM data is collected from car manufacturers and represents factory shipments. Another widely referenced source is the China Passenger Car Association ( CPCA ), a non-governmental organisation that provides wholesale, retail sales and exports for passenger cars, but is not qualified to provide national statistics, and it does not cover all OEMs, whereas CAAM does. The China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) is a state-owned think tank, and collects car production numbers from vehicle identification numbers and car sales numbers from vehicle insurance registrations. In China, vehicle insurance is registered for the vehicle itself and not for the individual driver, and is therefore useful for tracking the number of vehicles on the road, including imports. The main differences between CATARC data and the other sources stem from exports and military or other cars that do not get registered, and inventory stocks of vehicle manufacturers. In 2022 the total exports of passenger cars increased rapidly, making the differences between these data sources more apparent. In 2022 the export of passenger vehicles increased by almost 60%, exceeding 2.5 million, while the imports of passenger vehicles decreased by almost 20% (950 000 to 770 000). Similar discrepancies between factory shipments and insurance registrations are apparent in the Chinese bus and truck (commercial vehicle) market. In both 2021 and 2022, total volumes of factory shipments were substantially higher than insurance registrations, implying net export shares of commercial vehicles of about 9% in 2021 and more than 13% in 2022. Number of commerical vehicle sales and vehicle registration in China reported by various sources, 2020-2022 Open expand Number of passenger car sales and insurance registration in China reported by various sources, 2020-2022 Open expand Electric light commercial vehicles Sales of electric light commercial vehicles continue to increase, catching up with electric car sales Electric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales worldwide nearly doubled in 2022 relative to 2021 to more than 310 000 vehicles, even as overall LCV sales declined by more than 10%. At a global level, the electric LCV sales share is 3.6%, about one-quarter that of passenger cars. Current trends indicate that the electric LCV market is catching up with that of electric cars, suggesting that the gap in terms of EV sales shares could narrow in the future. For the first time in 2022, the increase in the share of electric LCVs outpaced that of electric passenger cars (albeit from a low base). This demonstrates that once a critical tipping point in terms of favourability of total cost of ownership (TCO) has been achieved, commercial vehicle purchasers are likely to respond more rapidly to economic fundamentals than private consumers. Commercial vehicle owners typically use their vehicles more intensively, and as they have an imperative to maximise profit, EVs provide an opportunity to considerably reduce operating costs. The experience of commercial owners can also provide learnings for the private consumers segment: better fleet and charging management could help address concerns over range limitations. The share of PHEVs in LCVs has remained very low; around 98% of both electric LCV sales and stock in 2022 were BEVs. It is likely that this reflects the economic favourability of the battery electric powertrain – as opposed to plug-in hybrids – in commercial operations characterised by intensive usage, regularity and predictability (in terms of driving range, geographic extent, and return-to-base for overnight charging), as well as the lower maintenance and service costs of battery electric LCVs. Battery electric LCV adoption may also be spurred on by the continuing expansion of low- and zero-emission zones. Electric light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales and sales shares, 2018-2022 Open expand In 2022, China led in terms of overall electric LCV sales with over 130 000 units sold, and nearly 15% of LCVs sold being electric. 7 Subsidies for battery electric and fuel cell trucks and vocational vehicles (including LCVs) have decreased in recent years, but overall zero-emission commercial truck sales have been growing since 2020, even as subsidies per vehicle have declined, indicating the increasing commercial competitiveness of electric trucks. In terms of market share, Korea continued to lead in 2022 with 27% of LCV sales being electric (36 000 vehicles), but sales growth in 2022 slowed to half its level in the previous year. This may be due to changes to the subsidy scheme for LCVs and to the repealing in April 2022 of a policy that made obtaining commercial registration permits easier for electric LCVs than ICE models (see Policy developments and corporate strategy ). Light commercial EV sales shares also grew substantially in the Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 25%, Iceland 16%, and Sweden 13%. In all other key European and North American national markets, shares are lower than 10%, and typically less than the global average of 3.5%, but the rate of growth in market share for electric LCVs was higher than for passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) (albeit from a lower baseline) across most leading EV markets, including the United States, Japan, and the European Union. Electric two- and three-wheelers Electric two-wheeler sales declined in China while global electric three-wheeler sales continued to rise Global electric two-wheeler sales totalled about 9.2 million in 2022, a drop of nearly 18% from 2021. This drop is almost entirely attributable to the dip in sales of electric mopeds and motorcycles in China, which fell from 10.2 million in 2021 to under 7.7 million in 2022, even as the overall two-wheeler market there continued to grow. Supply chain challenges stemming from China’s pandemic-related restrictions in 2022 hit the electric two-wheeler market particularly hard, and in spite of growth in sales of premium domestic and imported two-wheelers (e.g. from BMW, Ducati and others), the overall sales share of electric two-wheelers dipped back below 50%. 8 Despite the decline in sales, China continued to dominate the electric two-wheeler market in terms of size, accounting for nearly 85% of global sales. Electric two-wheelers also lost market share in Viet Nam, despite sales shares of domestically produced electric two-wheelers having increased considerably in recent years. In terms of absolute volumes, sales grew in most Asian markets outside China and Viet Nam. India leads on sales of electric three-wheelers thanks to policy support and innovative business models Sales of electric three-wheelers, which play an important role in urban mobility in India for both cargo and passenger services, soared to 425 000 units in 2022. Sales have been strong in India for a number of years, with hundreds of thousands of electric three-wheelers sold every year since 2012, with the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic reduced sales volumes to 30% of the previous year. Over half of India’s three-wheeler registrations in 2022 were electric, demonstrating their growing popularity due government incentives and lower lifecycle costs compared with conventional models, as well as higher fuel prices. IEA analysis on the TCO in India suggests that electric three-wheelers are already 70% cheaper than their gasoline-power ICE equivalents over their lifetime (IEA, forthcoming). Policies including the purchase incentives under FAME II, supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, tax benefits and India’s Go Electric campaign all contributed to reducing the higher upfront costs (see Policy developments and corporate strategy for a detailed discussion of these and other policies). A total of 15 Indian states have already adopted EV policies to promote stronger EV deployment (and many more are drafting them), the majority of which include additional demand incentives. Bulk procurement schemes, the emergence of the battery-as-a-service (BaaS) business model and India’s draft battery swapping policy all give further impetus to the rapidly rising sales of electric three-wheelers. China followed India in terms of electric three-wheeler sales, with nearly 350 000 units sold in 2022. Together, China and India accounted for nearly 99% of global electric three-wheeler sales. Korea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth In 2022, the stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased 40% compared to 2021, reaching over 72 000 vehicles globally. About 80% of the FCEVs are cars, 10% trucks and almost 10% buses. In 2022, the fuel cell truck segment grew at a faster rate than cars and buses, increasing 60%. Korea is now home to over half of all fuel cell cars globally. Two-thirds of the additional 15 000 fuel cell cars that hit the road in 2022 were in Korea. This can be attributed in part to a policy landscape that supports FCEV production and sales, which has also led to Hyundai being the top fuel cell automaker. The United States holds the second largest FCEV stock, with over 15 000 FCEVs. Most of these are fuel cell cars, with a little more than 200 fuel cell buses. In 2022, the stock of FCEVs in the United States increased more than 20%, which is much less than the 60% growth in China, which has the third largest FCEV stock. Historically, China has dominated the heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle segments (trucks and buses). This is still the case in 2022, with China home to over 95% of the global fuel cell truck fleet and almost 85% of the global fuel cell bus fleet. However, in 2022, China added over 200 fuel cell cars to its FCEV fleet after years of only deploying buses and trucks. For further details on the status of FCEVs and other hydrogen-based applications, see the IEA Global Hydrogen Review report series.

Where possible, data on new vehicle registrations is used. In some cases, however, only data on retail sales (such as sales from a dealership) are available. See section On the distinction between vehicle registrations and vehicle sales for further details. The term car is used to represent passenger light-duty vehicles and includes cars of different sizes, sports utility-vehicles and light trucks. Unless otherwise specified, the term electric vehicle is used to refer to both battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles but does not include fuel cell electric vehicles. For a brief description of the trends related to fuel cell electric vehicles, see section Korea continues to lead fuel cell electric car growth. NEVs (China) include BEVs, PHEVs and fuel cell electric vehicles. Europe includes European Union countries, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye, and the United Kingdom. Manufacturer caps were still in place for sales taking place in 2022, with models by carmakers having sold over 200 000 EVs losing eligibility for the purchase incentive, even if they were manufactured in North America following requirements under the IRA. Caps were removed starting from 2023. However, Tesla has decreased car prices several times since the publication of the IRA in the United States, in part to boost sales as competition gets tougher (see section on corporate strategy and finance ). Commercial truck sales in China are reported according to four gross vehicle weight (GVW) bins: less than 1.8 tonnes, 1.8-6 tonnes, 6-14 tonnes, and greater than 14 tonnes. These are reallocated to categories based on other external data sources to match IEA’s harmonised global definitions of light commercial vehicles (less than 3.5 tonnes GVW), medium trucks (3.5-15 tonnes), and heavy trucks (15 tonnes GVW and above). As with other vehicle types, tracking new two-wheeler registrations (“sales”) in China is difficult, as the official data source, CAAM, tracks factory shipments, and hence reports volumes that include exported vehicles. Tracking is particularly difficult in the case of electric two-wheelers, however, as many data sources include pedal-electric bicycles and other small electric mopeds (see, for instance, a recent industry report from Honda). Chinese data sources give vehicle sales of electric two-wheelers at around 50 million in 2021, and 60 million in 2022, of which about 7.6 million are classified as motorcycles ( China Chamber of Commerce for Motorcycles ). Some of these attain top speeds of less than 50 km/hour, and so are excluded from the above figures. In India, electric bicycles and mopeds with a top speed of less than 50 km/hour made up more than 80% of the market in 2021 and 2022.

            } Learn more automotive electrification trends from our latest insights and solutions. What are the latest vehicle electrification trends? How will the automotive industry contribute to the global goal of carbon neutrality? The auto industry's transition to EVs is accelerating. The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up. The top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances. The solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age. Talk to a S&P Global Mobility representative about our powertrain and sustainable mobility solutions LEARN MORE > How many vehicles sold last month?

Mouse over any country to reveal last month’s electrified vehicle sales. LEARN MORE > FAQs What is the future of the EV market? S&P Global Mobility has significantly revised up its EV penetration rate forecasts. The forecasts for global BEV passenger car production based on our September 2022 powertrain forecast are 41 million in 2030—approximately 42% of total global production of 97 million cars. What is the trend of electric vehicles? The EU has the strongest regulatory pressure and shows the highest OEM ambition to phase out the internal combustion engine vehicles. About 64% of passenger cars sold in 2030 will be a battery electric vehicles compared with 55% in the previous forecast setting of first quarter 2021. What are the major risks to the EV market outlook? Risks to EV adoption include shifting policy environments, the emerging interplay between consumer and OEM, and the cost profile of battery electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles. When will EV adoption accelerate? The year 2026 emerges as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption with more than one in four new passenger cars produced will be an electric vehicle.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million. Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about one-third from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020. About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars. Numerous factors contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis. Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets. Europe Overall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands. This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the European Union’s CO 2 emissions standards that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European governments increased subsidy schemes for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic. In European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%). China The overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%. Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered. Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic, several cities relaxed car licence policies , allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries. United States The US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations, reaching their limit . Other countries Electric car markets in other countries were resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000. New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown. Another exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share. Consumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises Consumer spending Consumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV. Government spending Governments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020. All the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many countries responded to the pandemic -induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened. An important novelty in subsidy schemes was the introduction of price caps in Europe and China , i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper. Consumer and government spending on electric cars, 2015-2020 Open expand More electric car models are available; ranges start to plateau Electric car models available globally and average range, 2015-2020 Open expand Electric car models available by region, 2020 Open expand Automakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models Worldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled. BEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level. The average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years. The widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons: SUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States. SUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car. Electrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles goes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car. In Europe, the ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO 2 emissions standards offers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO 2 emissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market. China leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market Global electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader. Electric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%. In Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by CO 2 standards that limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars. Registration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs. The explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about air pollution , particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced plans to electrify delivery fleets . Electric LCVs registrations by region, 2015-2020 Open expand 18 of the 20 largest OEMs have committed to increase the offer and sales of EVs Original equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles Open expand Original equipment manufacturer announcements related to electric light-duty vehicles Close dialog Download image Download image Sources BMW (2021); BJEV-BAIC (2021); BYD (2021); Chery (2021); Changan Automobile (2021); Daimler (2021); Dongfeng (2021); FAW (2021); Ford (2021); GAC; General Motors; Honda (2021); Hyundai (2020); Mazda (2021); Renault-Nissan (2019); Maruti Suzuki (2019); SAIC (2021); Stellantis (2021); Toyota (2021); Volkswagen (2021). Notes This table is based on the authors’ understanding of OEM announcements and may not be complete. It includes only announcements related to electric 
light-duty vehicles (PHEVs and BEVs) and it excludes announcements related to hybrid vehicles and those that do not provide a clear indication of the EV share. Manufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario OEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs). A number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond previous announcements related to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond. Significantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included: Volvo will only sell electric cars from 2030 ; Ford will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030 ; General Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035 ; Volkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030 ; and Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States . Overall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV projections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario . By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario. OEMs’ announcements compared to electric LDVs stock projections, 2021-2025 Open expand Trends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles Electric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020 Electric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000. Bus registrations China continues to dominate the electric bus market , with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force. Electric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding European Clean Bus Deployment Initiative and demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies. In North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020. Heavy-duty truck registrations Global electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both.

Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations. The growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as Daimler , MAN , Renault , Scania and Volvo have indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs. The HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.

Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative update on private sector commitments Despite a turbulent year, major companies around the world are accelerating the transition to electric mobility by shifting fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging stations. The Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative brings together over 100 companies in 80 markets committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030. Collectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks. EV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations. Significant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. To help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. Top 5 barriers to EV adoption reported by EV100 member companies Open expand Battery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand Automotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity. China accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh. Nickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market. According to the BNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices, the weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by teardown analysis of a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells. In Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but announced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025 . Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the European Investment Bank . In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large investments in a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture. Battery demand by region, 2015-2020 Open expand Battery demand by mode, 2015-2020 Open expand Pandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility Electric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility. Sales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled in 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%. Many shared micromobility operators reduced or suspended services during the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with 270 cities worldwide relaunching operations . As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020. Preliminary data from operators indicate average trip distances on e-scooters have increased by around 25% relative to before the pandemic . Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to expand into electric mopeds , which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit. Several major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of swappable batteries increases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles. Privately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives. Availability of dockless shared micromobility services in Europe and Central Asia, 2019-2021 Open expand Korea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs. To address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks. In 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks. In 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%. Fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen refueling station stock by region, 2020 Open expand Fuel cell electric vehicles stock by region and by mode, 2020 Open expand Deployment of vehicle-charging infrastructure Publicly accessible slow and fast chargers increased to 1.3 million in 2020 Stock of slow public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020 Open expand Stock of fast public electric light duty vehicles chargers, 2015-2020 Open expand Installation of publicly accessible chargers expanded sevenfold in the last five years; Covid-19 muted the pace in 2020 while China still leads While most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers. Slow chargers The pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers. Europe is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020. Installation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place. Fast chargers The pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment. In Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers. Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle. Most countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive (AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries. AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020. In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy. Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can largely use private home charging . To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark. Ratio of public chargers per EV stock by country, 2020 Open expand Planning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020. HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate standardisation . Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the high power requirements of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed. Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an ultra-high power charging standard (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative established a task force called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the combined charging system (CCS) standard . Prototype testing started in September 2020 . Tesla announced in late 2020 that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN. Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs. There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with stimulus funding , Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an open-access test centre for companies and academia that offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.

READ ALL STORIES NEWS & BUZZ News Blog Awards Events Resources Glossary Search for: Search Button BLOG Top EV Charging Industry Trends in 2024: New Players Getting into the Game Posted By Rami Honig February 18, 2024 EV adoption is still growing fast. In 2023, EVs grabbed a 12% share of the global market, but that number is expected to increase by 25 – 30% in 2024 to reach a 16% market share that amounts to 13.3 million BEVs sold this year. And yet, in North America, J.D. Power’s 2023 edition of the US Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Public Charging study surfaced that public charging station availability is still the top deterrent for EV adoption in North America. Seems range anxiety is still an issue. While federal funding aims to install 500,000 chargers by 2030, some estimates show a need for 1.2 million chargers by the end of the decade. This gap presents opportunities for new players to enter the EV charging market. This post will look at a few EV Charging industry trends in 2024; three industries adjacent to EV charging that have recognized the potential and getting into the game. You may be surprised to find out though, that it’s not necessarily direct revenue from EV charging that is tickling their bottom lines. Cumulative demand for chargers in 2030 in the U.S. ( Source: McKinsey ) EV Charging Industry Trends 2024 Will Include New Players Getting into the Game Charge where you park Ten years ago, when you wanted to refuel your car, you drove to a gas station. There was no other option. With the emergence of EVs, all that has changed. Many businesses that have a parking lot want to tap into the huge potential of the EV charging market. Think of shopping malls, convenience stores, restaurants, office buildings – anywhere you’d leave your car for an extended period. But they’re not looking at cash for kilowatts. It’s the dwell time that’s ringing up the cash register in their ears. When charging up an EV, people spend an average of 23 minutes at a location compared to 5 minutes when pumping gas. Now, there’s an opportunity. Think of packaged goods, food service, and even a café-like experience connected to EV charging to generate the bulk of the profits. There are two approaches businesses can take. One is to partner with an established EV charging service provider to set up the EV charging operation. This presents advantages like lowering the costs, quick time-to-market, and benefiting from the provider’s expertise. Another option is to become that EV charging service provider lock, stock, and barrel. This approach might be better suited to large corporations that have resources for such a venture. Walmart is a great example, and the retail giant has announced plans to expand its network of nearly 1300 fast charging stations by adding thousands more at its 5000 plus Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. Evolution of gas stations Oil and gas companies are another example of deep-pocketed corporations, and they too are ramping up their EV charging game, taking advantage of their already-present gas stations. One example is Shell, a company that is using Driivz EV Charging and Energy Management platform to accelerate its deployment of charging locations across Europe. Since Shell’s purchase of Ubitricity in 2021 , it has effectively become the largest EV charging network operator in the UK. Similarly, BP is the 3 rd largest (as bp pulse) following the purchase of ChargeMaster in 2018 . Total UK charging points by operator (30 September 2023) Source: Energy Monitor Here too, these business giants are leveraging on that magic dwell time and investing in sprucing up the convenience stores attached to gas stations to entice people with additional goods and services. Batteries on wheels, charging included Intuitively, automotive OEMs and EV charging go together. It just makes sense. Buy an EV, and the home charger gets bundled in with the car. But automakers are taking it a step further and forging partnerships to increase their public EV charging stake. This has been Tesla’s model from the get-go, and since you can’t argue with success, others now want in. For example, GM has partnered with EVgo (also using Driivz to power it’s public network of fast EV charging stations ) to install thousands of chargers across Pilot and Flying J travel centers across North America. Not only is GM leveraging the 24/7 amenities offered at the travel centers, but they’re also benefiting from EVgo’s vast experience as one of the largest fast-charging networks in the US, to deliver a seamless charging experience to their drivers. Putting the driver at the center, GM has built EV charging into its apps and will leverage its drivers’ attention to offer exclusive benefits such as reserving chargers and offering discounts for EV charging. Another example is the Ionna EV charging network, launched by a consortium of seven automotive powerhouses (BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis). Ionna is trying to give Tesla a run for its money with a mission to deploy 30,000 fast charging stations by 2030 to “make EV charging accessible, reliable, and incredible convenient” as written in their mission statement. Naturally, the Ionna network will be integrated into each of the OEMs’ EV charging apps. In a separate initiative, Mercedes-Benz is building 400 charging plazas across North America. In line with the brand’s premium status, the sparkling plazas are designed to emanate luxury. While the charging plazas will be open to everyone, Mercedes-Benz drivers will get preferential treatment with enhanced capabilities like reserving chargers. It’s all about customer centricity to foster brand loyalty. EV charging is not just about kilowatts While EV charging infrastructure may continue to play catch-up with EV adoption in 2024, it will eventually win. It’s hard to say exactly when, but in the not-too-distant future, EV charging will be as accessible as pumping gas is today. Delivering kilowatts may be the underlying driving force, but these new EV charging network operators are looking at other benefits they hope to gain: Monetization, but not directly from kilowatts. They are looking at the dwell time as the window of opportunity to provide EV drivers with an experience (food, products, services, leisure) they’re willing to pay for. Brand reputation for being seen as “clean and green “ Increased customer loyalty fostered by putting drivers at the center and rewarding them for staying with the brand New insights into customer behavior around the EV charging experience When looking at EV Charging industry Trends 2024, let’s see that they all deliver on their promise to deploy all those charging stations. When those targets are met, then range anxiety will truly be a thing of the past. Get transportation industry updates (But not too often, don’t worry!)

Search Sarah Lozanova Jan 12 6 min read Electric Vehicle Trends For 2024: What to Expect in the EV Industry Updated: Jan 23 As we step into 2024, big changes are happening in the EV industry and the electrification of transportation. Electric vehicle trends for 2024 include lower electric car prices, an expansion of EV charging stations, and greater EV charging plug compatibility. Read on to learn about EV industry trends and how they're shaping the future of the electric vehicle market in the coming year. EV Sales Will Continue Rising in 2024 Sales are expected to keep growing in 2024, despite some reports suggesting a decline in 2023. Even though more EVs are sitting unsold at dealerships, the actual electric car sales numbers are still strong and their market share is growing. There will be nearly 1.9 million EV sales in the U.S. in 2024, according to projections. The third quarter of 2023 showed the best market growth in EV sales since late 2021, and by September, over 1 million new EVs were sold in 2023 . Though EV sales estimates for 2024 were adjusted down a bit, they still predict a 20% increase from 2023. Cox Automotive also thinks that in 2024, more than 10% of all vehicle sales will be electric, and when including hybrid vehicles, almost 24% of 2024 vehicle sales will be electric or hybrid. Global EV Industry Sales EV sales in 2024 are expected to be highest in China, followed by Europe, North America, South Korea, and Japan. In fact, six out of every ten EV sales globally are from China, where intensifying competition is driving down costs and manufacturer profits. Historically, EV sales have increased annually, and this trend is expected to continue throughout 2024. Declining Prices Will Make the EV Market More Affordable There are numerous EVs available for under $40,000 in 2024, especially after applying the federal EV tax credit. Although some car shoppers are priced out of the EV market, prices of electric passenger cars will continue to decrease for some models due to technology advancements. For example, as automakers enhance their battery technologies and formulations, it's anticipated that EV battery prices will decrease. This improvement allows for both extended battery ranges and reduced costs. Considering that batteries make up around 40% of an EV’s total cost , reducing battery expenses is likely to significantly decrease the overall price of EVs, contributing to increased electric car sales. Thus, increasing affordability is an important electric vehicle industry trend for 2024. Charging Stations Will Advance Boosting EV Industry Growth Indeed EV charging station infrastructure isn’t evenly distributed across the U.S., and California leads the way in the amount of EV charging stations, with more than 10,000 DC fast chargers . Yet, studies show that many Americans are wary of buying an EV due to charging issues. “Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” said Marc Coltelli , EY Americas eMobility Energy Leader. “At the EY organization, we are predicting 82 million EVs will be on US roads by 2035. To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers. The energy industry has a massive role to play in this transition and is seizing the opportunity by collaborating cross-sector to build and power a resilient EV charging network.” Some achievements during 2023 will lay the groundwork for advances in charging infrastructure for the EV industry. These efforts will shape electric vehicle trends for 2024. More EVs Will Become Compatible With Tesla Supercharging Network One major advancement in EV charging relates to the charging ports on EVs, but a series of announcements in 2023 show signs of progress. A joint announcement by seven automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Rivian, and Volvo, reveals plans to adopt Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) for their electric vehicles. This move is set to make the Tesla Supercharger network available to customers of these automakers from 2024 onwards. While most electric vehicles in the United States currently use the Combined Charging Station (CCS) charger plug, this shift signifies broader accessibility to Tesla's robust EV charging network. Tesla’s Supercharger is the largest rapid EV charging station network, with over 45,000 chargers in the U.S. A 2023 J.D. Power study on EV charging infrastructure shows that Tesla owners are relatively happy with the Supercharger network, but their satisfaction declines considerably when using EV charging stations outside the Tesla network. However, Superchargers have historically only been compatible with Tesla vehicles, and the user experience may change when the network is opened up to non-Tesla drivers. It’s difficult to predict if non-Tesla EV drivers will have the same smooth vehicle charging experience when the network becomes available to them. Automakers Partner to Create Massive EV Charging Station Network Seven major automakers unveiled plans last year for a collaborative effort to establish a high-powered electric vehicle charging network spanning North America, featuring 30,000 chargers. BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group, and Stellantis NV are joining forces to enhance the convenience, accessibility, and universal compatibility of EV charging. Positioned to rival Tesla Superchargers, this EV charging station network aims to capitalize on charger subsidies under the Biden administration. The electric car charging network, set to be operational in 2024 in the U.S. and later in Canada, will be open to any battery electric vehicle using either Tesla’s NACS or CCS charger plugs and will exclusively rely on renewable energy to combat climate change. Challenges for EV Charging Station Installers & Contractors The growth of the EV industry is creating opportunities for contractors. As the demand for EV charging infrastructure installers continues to grow, contractors face several challenges in this dynamic landscape: EV Charging Station Technology: EV charging technology is evolving rapidly with new standards and protocols. Installers must stay updated on the latest trends to effectively install and maintain EV charging station infrastructure. Permitting, Code, and Zoning Requirements : Installing multi-family residential and commercial EV charging stations usually involves permits and compliance with local regulations. Installers need to be well-versed in the permitting process to avoid delays and ensure regulatory adherence, or else partner with GreenLancer for permitting and engineering services . Competition: With the rising demand for EV charging stations, more players are entering the market. EV infrastructure installers must differentiate themselves through competitive pricing, excellent customer service, and expertise. Opportunities for EV Charging Station Installers & Contractors Despite the challenges, the future holds promise for EV charging station installers, making it a key EV industry trend for 2024. Emerging EV Charging Station Market : The demand for EV charging stations is expected to grow significantly, creating a vast market for installers. Skilled Contractor Workforce : The EV industry's expansion will increase the need for skilled professionals, providing job opportunities for electricians and technicians. Opportunities for Partnerships : EV charging station installers can explore partnerships with EV manufacturers, utilities, and GreenLancer to expand their reach and offer comprehensive EV charging solutions. Electric Vehicles Eligible for Tax Credits Change in 2024 The eligibility requirements for federal tax credits for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles have changed for vehicles placed in service between January 1 and December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2024, eligibility will be assessed on a per-vehicle basis rather than by model. Also, EV buyers must meet eligibility requirements, including income eligibility. Automakers will submit the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles to the IRS, ensuring that only those specific vehicles are eligible for a tax credit. Car shoppers can obtain information from dealerships regarding the specific eligibility status of individual electric cars. One of the best ways to determine if a specific electric vehicle is eligible is to refer to the Treasury Department list. Electric Vehicles Eligible for $7,500 Tax Credit in 2024 Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV (2022 and 2023 EV models, priced at or below $55,000, the Bolt was discontinued for the 2024 model year) Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Ford F-150 Lightning (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Tesla Model 3 Performance (2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $55,000) Tesla Model X Long Range (2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Tesla Model Y All-Wheel Drive (2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000); Performance (2023 and 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000); and Rear-Wheel Drive (2024 model year only, priced at or below $80,000) Electric Vehicles Eligible for $3,750 Tax Credit in 2024 Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Plug-In Hybrid (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Jeep Wrangler 4xe Plug-In Hybrid SUV (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring Plug-In Hybrid (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) Rivian R1S and R1T (2022 to 2024 models, priced at or below $80,000) EV Industry Growth in 2024 Creates Opportunities for Contractors The electric vehicle market is experiencing significant growth. This trend towards sustainable transportation is motivated by various factors, including heightened environmental concerns and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, widespread governmental incentives and policies supporting EV adoption, continuous advancements in battery technology resulting in longer driving ranges, and the decreasing costs of electric vehicles.

The electric vehicle trends 2023 brings will lead the way to a full electrified world. In this article, we explore 8 major EV trends that forecast widespread EV adoption in 2023 and beyond: 10 minute read Table of Content Traditional automakers committed to investing billions in electric vehicles Deals for large purchase orders to electrify fleets Traditional automakers increasing spending on EV advertising Big Tech companies also entering the EV industry EV charging infrastructure is rapidly expanding Cost of EVs continues dropping Consumers are increasingly receptive to purchasing electric vehicles Sales of electric vehicles have accelerated over the last few years Discover the Exro Coil Driver™ The electric vehicle industry, with its prospects and challenges, has been gaining prevalence for several years, but more recently signs of widespread EV adoption have become especially apparent. Is there any doubt that the future is electric? Consumers, companies, and governments are all moving with increasing speed towards electrification. Potential barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles, although still a reality, are being rapidly overcome. 2021 and 2022 brought several notable examples of electrification, including a renewed commitment to global emissions targets, clean energy market growth and commercial vehicle electrification as major electrification trends. Within the span of a few years, much has transpired in the industry and the vision of the electric future is even clearer. Now, what are the particular EV trends that forecast widespread electric vehicle adoption in 2023 and beyond? 1. Traditional automakers committed to investing billions in electric vehicles Not only have automakers pledged to make a significant percentage of their cars electric over the next decade, but many, such as Ford, Volkswagen and Honda, have already announced sizable investments to accelerate EV production over the coming years. It is estimated that the automotive industry will invest over $500 billion by 2030 for its EV transition. In recent years, the variety of electric car models was extremely limited, and it served as one of many barriers to electric vehicle adoption. But there is no longer a shortage of electrification examples on the part of car manufacturers. Now that traditional automakers are attuned to the business opportunities in electric vehicles, the investments in EV innovation and manufacturing facilities are swelling. In turn, the number of EV options for consumers is quickly rising. 2. Deals for large purchase orders to electrify fleets Hertz’s order for 100,000 vehicles from Tesla resulted in the company surpassing a $1 trillion market cap in the final quarter of 2021. While the agreements of most automakers with car rental companies are unremarkable, Hertz’s order was a clear signal that electrification was becoming mainstream. Perhaps even more impressive was the investment by Amazon and the announcement of Amazon’s 100,000 EV order from Rivian , which occurred almost two years prior to the Hertz-Tesla deal. Both orders signify a huge move to electric vehicles. Other notable electrification examples include the large electric fleet orders in GM’s deals with Walmart and FedEx . Given the huge impact that heavy duty electric vehicles have both on cost-savings and on the reduction of emissions, the acceleration of electric truck adoption among other vehicles is a very significant electrification trend. As more and more companies realize the benefits of electrifying their fleets, the strengthening of this electrification trend becomes inevitable. 3. Traditional automakers increasing spending on EV advertising Automakers are well-aware that without the interest of consumers in electric modes of transportation, they will not be able to successfully transition into the EV market. Other than rare magazine articles on electric cars or the niche publications about electrification, until recently mainstream media was largely devoid of the subject. Prior to 2021, there had been relatively little advertising attention given to electric vehicles. While traditional automakers have a history of heavily advertising, EVs were clearly not their top priorities. In addition, the leading automaker in the EV market, Tesla, is renowned for not advertising at all. Electric vehicles were essentially absent from advertising. But this changed in 2021. Automakers went from $83M and $65M in 2019 and 2020 respectively, to an unprecedented EV advertising spend of $248M in 2021. The start of 2022 seems to follow the same trend, as evident by several Super Bowl ads from major automakers . Interestingly, Tesla’s powerful brand recall in the category of electric vehicles made the company a major beneficiary of these EV Super Bowl ads, despite all the advertising efforts coming from other automakers. Given the Super Bowl’s status as one of the most expensive television advertising slots, and the huge attention given to all Super Bowl commercials, it is no coincidence that the major automakers are shifting gears to go full speed towards EVs, taking the public with them. Of course, there is still much room for EVs to grow in prominence since total advertising budgets for the major car brands total upwards of $3 billion. A continuous shrinking of advertising spend will be inevitable in the future of gasoline cars as automakers shift their focus to the EV revolution. 4. Big Tech companies also entering the EV industry On the one hand, there are the electric-only automakers, such as the pioneer Tesla and the more recent Rivian. On the other hand, there are the traditional automakers who have more recently recognized the widespread EV revolution gaining momentum and are rapidly investing to enter the market. But there is a third group that is interestingly also venturing into electric vehicles: technology companies. For years there have been rumors and news of companies such as Apple , Google and Amazon developing or investing in electric cars, particularly with a focus on self-driving systems. Chinese big tech has also been keen to enter into the autonomous EV market, with the likes of Huawei, Baidu and Xiaomi making large investments. The surprising news from consumer electronics company Sony of a prototype EV , announced at CES at the start of 2022, was further evidence that the EV market looks extremely promising and will soon approach widespread adoption. It seems no company wants to be left out, and it appears consumers are also open to the idea. In a recent Canadian survey 49% of respondents expressed willingness to buy an electric car built by a technology company. Boost your EV range or downsize battery packs without sacrificing range.

EV charging infrastructure is rapidly expanding Governments at all levels are increasingly investing in a variety of charging infrastructure to support widespread EV adoption. In the United States, the Biden Administration revealed a plan to spend almost $5 billion over five years in order to build a large network of electric vehicle charging stations. A hope of this plan is to have a charging station every 50 miles along interstate highways so that drivers can sustain longer trips with their EVs, which could possibly reduce some of the concerns drivers have with adopting electric vehicles. In addition to EV charging station growth due to government efforts, companies have also made EV infrastructure more widely available to the public. Tesla’s Supercharger network has historically been one of the benefits of owning a car from the company, but a pilot project released in November of 2021 changed that. The project began to allow drivers of other electric vehicles to use the company’s extensive charging network, albeit only in select countries in Europe. Even so, this signals a significant move both for Tesla and for the market at large, especially if the number of countries for whom access to their EV charging stations is available expands soon. A host of other companies, some specializing in EV charging, some oil companies, hotels and stores among others, have also started to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Since the lack of charging infrastructure is chief among the barriers to EV adoption, it will be vital that electric charging stations continue to be built at an accelerating rate. Overcoming barriers to deployment of plug-in electric vehicles will necessarily require electric charging stations and infrastructure matching the prevalence of gas stations. At the same time, EV charging behavior will have to be studied closely so that infrastructure needs are tended to adequately. For instance, not every charger may take the form of its gas station counterpart. Public chargers that also serve as electric vehicle parking for those who do not have access to a garage is a need many city dwellers have. Both the prospects and challenges for electric vehicle infrastructure are many, but EV charging station growth over the last year has been a promising trend. 6. Cost of EVs continues dropping One of the issues with electric vehicles that consumers struggle with is the upfront cost of purchase. Most people expect to purchase an EV for less than $50,000 according to a Canadian survey . Given the high cost of batteries, electric vehicle inverters, motors, and other parts, automakers in general have not yet passed this threshold. However, trends are promising in showing just how close the industry is to this point. Over the years, the cost of battery packs, for instance, which make up a significant percentage of electric vehicle manufacturing cost, has plummeted. A lithium-ion battery pack went from an average cost of $1,200 per kWh in 2010 to $132 per kWh by the end of 2021, an impressive 89% decrease. This cost is very close to the $100 per kWh mark that would make the pricing of electric vehicles competitive with their internal combustion engine counterparts. Interestingly, the price of new vehicles in general rose by an average of 2.2% from 2020 to 2021 , in contrast to EVs, which decreased by 10.8% during the same period. This electrification trend clearly hints at the future of ICE cars and their electric counterparts. It is only a matter of time before pricing is overcome as a barrier to EV adoption. 7. Consumers are increasingly receptive to purchasing electric vehicles A growing number of consumers have accepted that the future is electric. While survey results for EV purchase consideration vary widely, they generally indicate high interest by the public. One survey showed that in the United States, some 60% of consumers would consider purchasing an electric vehicle. A different survey, with more specific and practical considerations in its questions, showed a more conservative but still significant percentage of respondents considering purchasing EVs, namely 23% of Americans . Yet another survey says 48% of Americans would consider buying an EV. Regardless of the exact percentage, these reports seem to indicate that the number exceeds double digits, suggesting a general trend of increasing consideration towards the purchase of electric vehicles. This electrification trend has consisted of a tremendous shift towards electric vehicles in the mind of the public. Whereas in the past many might have thought “I will never buy an electric car” and that electric cars will fail, now increasingly cultural attitudes revolve around questions such as “what if all cars were electric?”, ""why EVs are the future"" and popular phrases such as “the EV revolution”. It is important to note, however, that it is not just in theory that consumers are considering buying electric vehicles. The data clearly indicates that sales of electric vehicles are accelerating as evident by the next trend. 8. Sales of electric vehicles have accelerated over the last few years What would happen if everyone used electric cars? What does the future hold for electric cars? Pondering such questions will soon be not merely a speculative exercise, but a present reality. According to the International Energy Agency , global market share of electric vehicles grew from a negligible 0.01% in 2010 to 4.11% in 2020, and an astonishing rise to 8.57% in 2021. The electric vehicle adoption curve is impressive. China and Europe see the fastest growth, and the United States is behind them with a more gradual growth. Given the data and reports on consumer attitudes after lockdowns , it is evident that the pandemic had a considerable contribution to this growth. Furthermore, some projections of 2022 EV sales estimate at least a 50% growth in relation to 2021. By most accounts, the markets all seem to be accelerating rapidly toward mass electrification. The view is clear, the fast-approaching world of widespread EV adoption is almost here. Overcoming EV adoption barriers with a dynamic EV inverter What defines the speed of vehicle electrification trends? Not only electric vehicle prospects but also challenges. Even considering the above electrification trends, we know the current market share of EVs compared to other vehicles is nowhere near the percentage of consumers receptive to EVs, especially in the United States. In this respect, we know that there are still barriers impeding consumers from taking the step to convert to electric vehicles. Among these EV adoption barriers are charging infrastructure, vehicle performance, and cost. Electric vehicle performance and cost can be greatly improved by the revolutionary EV inverter that is the Coil Driver™ . Exro Technologies is a clean technology company pioneering intelligent control solutions in power electronics to help solve the most challenging problems in electrification and foster rapid adoption of EVs.

By Sammie Eastwood January 01, 2023 undefined mins With easing supply issues opening up the market, 2023 is set to be the year of electric vehicles. Let’s look at the trends shaping the market next year Opinion piece provided by Sammie Eastwood, Guest Editor. A lot has happened in 2022 when it comes to the world of electric vehicles (EVs) , and 2023 is set to be even bigger bringing more advancements in the EV market. Technology in the sector is moving in leaps and bounds, and, despite supply chain disruptions putting strain on manufacturers, 2023 is set to be one of the best years for electric vehicle adoption yet . With this in mind, let’s take a look at some of the biggest trends we’re anticipating in the EV sector in 2023. EV batteries set to improve Battery technology has come a long way in the last decade, with greater demand leading to a 85% decrease in cost —an advancement that opened the doorway for the EV market to flourish. And it doesn’t stop there. One organisation at the forefront of this innovation is Formula E, which has been busy preparing a battery for its 3rd gen vehicle, which will be hitting the track in 2023. As its Chief of Staff, Hannah Brown , said during the ‘Racing towards EV’ panel at Sustainability LIVE 2022, “ The FIA and a bunch of engineers are up at Williams [Advanced Engineering] right now putting the new battery through its paces. This is a battery that’s going to do something that no battery has done before in terms of 600kW of power in and out of that thing and delivering huge amounts of energy within the race” . To add to this, new car models emerging next year are set to have 350-500 miles of range on one charge—that’s enough to get you from London to Glasgow! A distance that will go a long way to curing range anxiety. High fuel prices still give EVs a competitive edge Besides being kinder to the planet, one of the greatest appeals of EVs is that the running costs are significantly lower than their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts . Despite worries about energy price hikes, using strategies like overnight home charging or free charging points available throughout the UK, it's still possible to run an EV at a much lower cost than ICEs. Plus, with the news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is planning to reduce crude oil production significantly in the coming year, the cost of fossil fuels is expected to rise. With all these factors added together, making the switch to EV is becoming more desirable by the day. Increase in charging infrastructure A big barrier to people making the switch to EV has been the worry about lack of charging infrastructure. However, there will be an even bigger push to electrify the UK through schemes like Shell Recharge , which recently announced a partnership with ABB , the legacy company that has been working tirelessly to create new infrastructure. Adding to this, the UK Government has pledged to invest £20m for EV charging infrastructure next year in an effort to increase EV adoption throughout the nation. This means more charging forecourts, more subsidies to create on-street and home-charging stations, more businesses offering charging facilities. There is still a long way to go before we reach a fully electrified UK, but things are heading in the right direction. AI-powered vehicle health checks Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to play a big role in the future of EV in the coming years. Not only in the self-driving car market, but it will also be used to give diagnostics on our cars . Because EVs have less moving parts, AI will be powerful enough to give a full spectrum, real-time assessment of the vehicle, which inspectors can use to check the vehicles whenever they change hands. AI can deliver fast information on issues with the vehicle before they become a problem, or give a detailed warning about what might be wrong, saving time at the garage and money. AI could even be used to power parametric insurance policies that allow your provider to adjust your premiums in real time. Better insights means you only pay based on your own driving habits, not other people’s. Smart grid technologies The energy price hikes have made a lot of people nervous about how the National Grid will cope with the increased burden created by charging EVs. However, there have been great steps taken into making the grid greener and more efficient. Smart schemes like Intelligent Octopus leverage tariffs to encourage charging when there is least demand on the grid, meaning less energy needs to be generated to keep up with demand. Vehicle-to-home (VtH), also known as bi-directional chargers , are also being offered to allow consumers to use reserve EV battery to power homes during peak times, which also takes pressure off the grid. Then power is rerouted back to the EV overnight, when power usage is at its lowest, making the most of the power already available. ev electricvehicles automotive ai Share Share Related Content Tussell: Government to spend £3.3bn on EV charging by 2030 Charging & Infrastructure Osprey Charging & EVA England on EV Infrastructure Charging & Infrastructure Renault Halts Ampere EV IPO Amidst Equity Market Challenges Sustainability Rolls-Royce’s sustainable luxury electric vehicles Sustainability Featured Articles Siemens’ Smart Train Rental Offers Greater Fleet Capacity Siemens Mobility’s subsidiary Smart Train Lease GmbH offers a new flexible leasing model for battery, hydrogen and electric multiple-unit trains … FedEx, EAV & Department for Transport unite on e-cargo bikes FedEx has expanded its sustainability operations with a new fleet of e-cargo bikes from EAV, after receiving funding from the Department for Transport … Smart charging for a sustainable future with ev.energy We sat down with Jeremy Yapp, Policy and Regulation Director, for a deep dive into ev.energy's app and its role in greener, cheaper and smarter EV charging … E-bus Mobility set to rise as Market saw 53% Growth in 2023 Commute Tesla's Self-Driving Safety Questioned at Super Bowl Self Drive Tussell: Government to spend £3.3bn on EV charging by 2030 Charging & Infrastructure An Arctic Odyssey with Lotus Emeya: Snow, Safety & Style Autocraft: EV Battery Management & Using Digital Twins Mastercard & Last Mile Empowering EV Payments & Charging Guided Energy's AI Platform Transforms Electric Fleets Electric Roadblocks for Polestar and Hertz After 2022 Deal EV Magazine is a new brand that represents all-things electric.

In 2023, EVs grabbed a 12% share of the global market, but that number is expected to increase by 25 – 30% in 2024 to reach a 16% market share that amounts to 13.3 million BEVs sold this year. And yet, in North America, J.D. Power’s 2023 edition of the US Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Public Charging study surfaced that public charging station availability is still the top deterrent for EV adoption in North America. Seems range anxiety is still an issue. While federal funding aims to install 500,000 chargers by 2030, some estimates show a need for 1.2 million chargers by the end of the decade. This gap presents opportunities for new players to enter the EV charging market. This post will look at a few EV Charging industry trends in 2024; three industries adjacent to EV charging that have recognized the potential and getting into the game. You may be surprised to find out though, that it’s not necessarily direct revenue from EV charging that is tickling their bottom lines.

There was no other option. With the emergence of EVs, all that has changed. Many businesses that have a parking lot want to tap into the huge potential of the EV charging market. Think of shopping malls, convenience stores, restaurants, office buildings – anywhere you’d leave your car for an extended period. But they’re not looking at cash for kilowatts. It’s the dwell time that’s ringing up the cash register in their ears. When charging up an EV, people spend an average of 23 minutes at a location compared to 5 minutes when pumping gas. Now, there’s an opportunity. Think of packaged goods, food service, and even a café-like experience connected to EV charging to generate the bulk of the profits. There are two approaches businesses can take. One is to partner with an established EV charging service provider to set up the EV charging operation. This presents advantages like lowering the costs, quick time-to-market, and benefiting from the provider’s expertise. Another option is to become that EV charging service provider lock, stock, and barrel. This approach might be better suited to large corporations that have resources for such a venture. Walmart is a great example, and the retail giant has announced plans to expand its network of nearly 1300 fast charging stations by adding thousands more at its 5000 plus Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. Evolution of gas stations Oil and gas companies are another example of deep-pocketed corporations, and they too are ramping up their EV charging game, taking advantage of their already-present gas stations. One example is Shell, a company that is using Driivz EV Charging and Energy Management platform to accelerate its deployment of charging locations across Europe. Since Shell’s purchase of Ubitricity in 2021 , it has effectively become the largest EV charging network operator in the UK. Similarly, BP is the 3 rd largest (as bp pulse) following the purchase of ChargeMaster in 2018 . Total UK charging points by operator (30 September 2023) Source: Energy Monitor Here too, these business giants are leveraging on that magic dwell time and investing in sprucing up the convenience stores attached to gas stations to entice people with additional goods and services. Batteries on wheels, charging included Intuitively, automotive OEMs and EV charging go together. It just makes sense. Buy an EV, and the home charger gets bundled in with the car. But automakers are taking it a step further and forging partnerships to increase their public EV charging stake. This has been Tesla’s model from the get-go, and since you can’t argue with success, others now want in. For example, GM has partnered with EVgo (also using Driivz to power it’s public network of fast EV charging stations ) to install thousands of chargers across Pilot and Flying J travel centers across North America. Not only is GM leveraging the 24/7 amenities offered at the travel centers, but they’re also benefiting from EVgo’s vast experience as one of the largest fast-charging networks in the US, to deliver a seamless charging experience to their drivers. Putting the driver at the center, GM has built EV charging into its apps and will leverage its drivers’ attention to offer exclusive benefits such as reserving chargers and offering discounts for EV charging. Another example is the Ionna EV charging network, launched by a consortium of seven automotive powerhouses (BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis). Ionna is trying to give Tesla a run for its money with a mission to deploy 30,000 fast charging stations by 2030 to “make EV charging accessible, reliable, and incredible convenient” as written in their mission statement. Naturally, the Ionna network will be integrated into each of the OEMs’ EV charging apps. In a separate initiative, Mercedes-Benz is building 400 charging plazas across North America. In line with the brand’s premium status, the sparkling plazas are designed to emanate luxury. While the charging plazas will be open to everyone, Mercedes-Benz drivers will get preferential treatment with enhanced capabilities like reserving chargers. It’s all about customer centricity to foster brand loyalty. EV charging is not just about kilowatts While EV charging infrastructure may continue to play catch-up with EV adoption in 2024, it will eventually win. It’s hard to say exactly when, but in the not-too-distant future, EV charging will be as accessible as pumping gas is today. Delivering kilowatts may be the underlying driving force, but these new EV charging network operators are looking at other benefits they hope to gain: Monetization, but not directly from kilowatts. They are looking at the dwell time as the window of opportunity to provide EV drivers with an experience (food, products, services, leisure) they’re willing to pay for. Brand reputation for being seen as “clean and green “ Increased customer loyalty fostered by putting drivers at the center and rewarding them for staying with the brand New insights into customer behavior around the EV charging experience When looking at EV Charging industry Trends 2024, let’s see that they all deliver on their promise to deploy all those charging stations. When those targets are met, then range anxiety will truly be a thing of the past. Get transportation industry updates (But not too often, don’t worry!)

In this Deloitte report, we take a new approach to market segmentation and exemplify how to seize opportunities and manage risks. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shook up the automotive industry – along with every other industry – electric vehicles were moving steadily into the spotlight. The combined annual sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles tipped over the two-million-vehicle mark for the first time in 2019. This much-anticipated milestone may have become overshadowed by economic uncertainty and changed consumer priorities, but there is value in taking stock of the electric vehicle market even now. Learn More Explore the Future of Mobility collection Learn about Deloitte's services Go straight to smart. Get the Deloitte Insights app Since Deloitte last presented a forecast for electric vehicle (EV) sales , in January 2019, the EV market has made great strides, and not just in terms of sales. OEMs have invested billions to deliver new electrified models, from R&D to factory redesign. Consumer attitudes have evolved. Government interventions have pushed forward and pulled back. But then COVID-19 completely disrupted global sales and manufacturing. In this context, a revised forecast based on updated data is needed. By examining the current state of the EV market worldwide and noting the many factors fostering growth in various directions (Part 1 of this report), we have formed conclusions about how the market will take shape over the next decade. The significant growth of EVs leading up to 2030 will present major opportunities and challenges for traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), new-entrant OEMs, captive finance companies and dealerships. In particular, traditional OEMs will find insights in this report that can help them re-prioritise their customers and strategies in a volatile competitive landscape. Paramount to seizing opportunities and managing risks is taking a new approach to market segmentation. We detail one such approach in Part 2 and apply it as a use case to one major market, the United Kingdom, to inform and inspire OEMs and other stakeholders globally. By letting today’s insights fuel the journey for the next ten years, we can accelerate beyond the obstacles the pandemic has brought and toward a future where EVs take centre stage. * In this report, we use the term electric vehicles (EVs) to refer to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 1 Unless specifically stated, our analysis has considered both forms of drivetrain. BEVs are powered solely by batteries. They use an electric motor to turn the wheels and produce zero emissions. PHEVs are capable of zero-emission driving, typically between 20 and 30 miles, and can run on petrol or diesel for longer trips. As the name suggests, they need to be plugged in to an electricity supply to maximise their zero-emission capability. Part 1 – Global progress and forecast The EV market’s collective accomplishments over the past two years offer hope, despite the short-term impact of COVID-19: a pattern of continued growth, which is expected to be sustained throughout the 2020s. As BEV and PHEV sales surpassed two million vehicles in 2019 (see figure 1), EVs staked their claim on a 2.5 per cent share of all new car sales last year. Looking back at BEVs in 2019, they accounted for 74 per cent of global EV sales: an increase of six percentage points since 2018. This rise was partly stimulated by new, stricter European emissions standards that persuaded manufacturers to favour the production and sale of zero-emission vehicles. Another factor is the advanced state of the BEV market in China, compared to the rest of the world. Although BEVs are still the dominant EV technology in the United States and Europe, they command a smaller share of the market than in China. Since the last time Deloitte reported on EV sales, significant regional disparities in growth have surfaced. For example, sales of EVs grew by 15 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by the growth of BEVs in Europe (+93 per cent), China (+17 per cent) and ‘other’ regions (+22 per cent). In contrast, the United States market for BEVs fell 2 per cent (see figure 1). Then, in the first half of 2020, COVID-19 slowed down the growth rate of EV sales, or sent it into decline, across various regions. The speed of recovery is expected to vary by region. But generally speaking, the course seems clear for growth over the next decade, despite the potential lasting impact of COVID-19 on total car sales over the next three years. To understand how things might continue, we need to understand what’s been taking place across the various regional markets over the past year. EVs in regional markets Europe Europe’s EV sector saw significantly more growth than other regions in 2019. The Nordics and the Netherlands continued to lead the way; Norway achieved 56 per cent market share, and two of the top ten best-selling cars in Holland were BEVs. 3 The United Kingdom and some other countries reported triple-digit growth for the year. Favourable government policies and a change in consumer attitudes were the catalysts, driven primarily by growing concerns about climate change. Climate change rose to the top of many European governments’ agendas. The United Kingdom committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and proposed a ban on the sale of all polluting vehicles by 2035. 4 Germany plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by the end of 2020, by 55 per cent by the end of 2030 and up to 95 per cent by the end of 2050, compared to 1990 levels. 5 Despite the growth seen in 2019, mainstream adoption of EVs has been, so far, hindered by the limited number of models available to the European market and consumer perceptions regarding insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions. 6 The outbreak of COVID-19 and national lockdown measures impacted total car sales in Europe, as showrooms closed their doors and manufacturers halted production, but EV sales have held up well in comparison to their internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents. In the first four months of 2020, in the European Union (EU), demand for new passenger cars contracted by 38.5 per cent, but in April 2020 – the first full month with COVID-19 restrictions in place – registrations of new passenger cars in the EU posted a year-on-year decline of 76.3 per cent, with some major markets reporting declines of over 95 per cent year-on-year. 7 But EV sales in Western Europe only fell by 31 per cent in April, with some countries actually reporting modest year-on-year growth – albeit against a low base. 8 China China continues to dominate the EV market, accounting for half of all vehicle sales. Sales in the second half of 2019 turned out lower than previously expected after some subsidies available to Chinese consumers were halved. 9 This considerably eroded the consumer demand for EVs, and total yearly sales dropped: PHEV sales fell by 9 per cent and BEV sales fell to a 17 per cent growth rate from 2018 to 2019. 10 On a positive note, a slowdown in the sales of ICE vehicles in the region means that the EV market share in China actually increased. China’s slowdown in the second half of 2019 affected global EV sales figures, but neither the slashed subsidies nor the impact of COVID-19 should impact EV sales significantly in the long term. Chinese authorities announced they would refrain from more subsidy cuts in 2020. 11 Meanwhile, other incentives (for example, number-plate privileges in Tier 1 cities) remain, investment is being made in China’s charging infrastructure and there is a continued focus on encouraging Chinese manufacturers to produce and market EVs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in place, China saw a 45 per cent decline in passenger car sales in Q1 2020. 12 EV sales fell at a faster rate than the total market (by 56 per cent), as consumers stayed home and showrooms closed their doors. 13 But the rate of recovery has been swift. By March 2020, Chinese factories had recovered to achieve a production rate of 75 per cent, with 86 per cent of employees returning to work. By April 2020, production had basically been restored to pre-pandemic levels. Although sales have remained depressed in certain Chinese provinces, recovery has been accelerated by pent-up demand, favourable policies put in place by Chinese authorities and the ability to purchase cars online; total sales actually reflected year-on-year growth in April. This brings hope for a ‘V-shaped’ recovery in China, with many individual EV manufacturers already benefitting from the release of new models. 14 United States After an encouraging start to 2019, falling fuel prices in the United States (a market that already enjoys comparatively cheap private transportation) led to a disappointing second half of the year for EV sales. The United States EV market is almost singlehandedly being carried by the success of the Tesla Model 3 – alone responsible for almost half of all EV sales. 15 As in Europe and China, United States car sales fell sharply in the first three months of 2020 as the pandemic took a toll on demand; job losses increased and large swathes of the population were ordered to stay home. The recovery in EV sales is likely to be slower in the United States than in other major regions, as manufacturers delay the launch of new cars and consumers take advantage of low oil prices. Rest of the world The world outside Europe, China and the United States is lagging behind in terms of EV sales, for various reasons: a lack of government commitment to EVs, insufficient or unsuitable charging infrastructure, unavailability of EVs and cultural differences regarding mobility models. For example, Japan is a major global car market, but new car sales are dominated by domestic OEMs that have not yet developed the same range of EVs as their European and Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, India, like many markets, is dominated by mass- and low-cost mobility models: an area that OEMs haven’t been able to penetrate so far, because of EVs’ comparative higher price. 2030 sales forecast With one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter. Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2) . Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term. Deloitte expects that by 2030 China will hold 49 per cent of the global EV market, Europe will account for 27 per cent, and the United States will hold 14 per cent. The share of new car sales taken up by EVs will vary considerably across markets (see figure 3). We forecast China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48 per cent by 2030 – almost double that of the United States (27 per cent), and Europe should achieve 42 per cent. But this doesn’t tell the whole story. Growth in Northern and Western Europe is expected to outstrip that in Southern and Eastern Europe as wealthier countries (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Nordic countries) likely invest more in infrastructure and offer greater cash and tax incentives to accelerate initial growth. EV growth beyond 2030 Beyond 2030, we expect the rate of growth in EV sales to slow. Some markets will be unable to support the transition to EVs in the same way that wealthier nations will over the next decade. Consider that, beyond 2030, one of the key factors in sustaining growth will be the implementation of suitable charging infrastructure. This requires multi-billion-dollar capital investments – achievable in some markets through a combination of public and private investment, but unlikely to be achieved uniformly around the world. In countries that cannot invest in charging infrastructure, we expect the market for ICE vehicles to remain for some time. Four factors driving growth Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. Factor 1 – Changing consumer sentiment Consumer demand will fuel the growth of EVs but, at the moment, there are several reasons consumers haven’t swapped their ICE vehicles for equivalent EVs. However, as the barriers to adoption are rapidly removed, EVs are increasingly becoming a realistic and viable option. Figure 4 shows how consumer concerns regarding BEVs have changed, and in many instances diminished, since 2018. From 2018 to 2020, there were some noticeable changes in consumer attitudes toward EVs. Concerns over the cost/price premium have diminished in every country apart from China (+ two percentage points), which has seen cuts in EV subsidies. Driving range has remained the number-one concern in Germany, and became number one in France, but there are now fewer consumers citing it as a concern in those two markets. Elsewhere, the lack of charging infrastructure has become the top priority for consumers, reflecting the possibility that they are starting to see EVs as a realistic option and are considering the practicalities of ownership. Over the next few years, we expect some barriers to be completely removed. EVs’ driving range is already comparable to that of ICE vehicles; price has already reached parity, if you consider subsidies in various markets and total cost of ownership; and the number of models available is increasing. As EV sales continue to grow and consumers see more of them on the roads, or travel in EVs owned by family or friends, we expect personal experiences to trump concerns. The expected proliferation of commercial EVs (such as vans, trucks, lorries) should also play a part in reassurance, as will the rise of mass-transit options (such as electric buses). Measures that governments take in their COVID-19 recovery plans could also affect consumer sentiment. As part of a $146 billion economic recovery plan, Germany has designated $2.8 billion to EV charging infrastructure and announced new legislation that will oblige all fuel stations to have an EV charging point. 19 This is significant progress in a country where driving range and lack of charging infrastructure are the two biggest barriers for consumers. China has made similar commitments, announcing an additional $378 million investment in charging infrastructure as part of a COVID-19 recovery plan. 20 Factor 2 – Policy and legislation Government intervention continues to play an important role in driving EV sales, as shown by the successes in Norway, fluctuating sales in the Netherlands and changing fortunes of the Chinese EV market. 21 Not only are there economic benefits for states that support a transition to electric, but the positive environmental impact has made the widespread adoption of EVs a necessary step toward achieving climate-change goals, such as those of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Several policies and regulations are helping encourage the growth of EV adoption: Fuel economy and emission targets These differ across markets and are under constant review and consultation by governments. Recent Deloitte analysis shows that with the phasing-in of new European CO 2 emission targets, which will be fully implemented in 2021 and bring punitive fines, 22 half of car manufacturers are facing related penalty payments. They’ll owe a total of $0.5 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2021, 23 which could cost the industry approximately $39 billion, based on recent emission levels. 24 Such government intervention is shaping OEM strategy: to avoid fines and reputational fallout, OEMs are seeking ways to reduce emissions through increased electrification. City access restrictions City governments have led the way on imposing bans, or punitive taxes, on users of older combustion engines, addressing increasing concerns about toxic air pollution.  In 2019 more cities followed the path already taken in Madrid, Mexico City, Rome and Seattle: Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona all took action to reduce the number of ICE vehicles on the road. Several United Kingdom cities also brought forward plans for bans and zero-/low-emission zones. Throughout 2020 we expect this trend to continue as cities worldwide grapple with air pollution and confront their relationships with combustion engines – and private cars in general. Financial incentives Many governments have offered compelling financial incentives to make the electric switch, such as providing cash subsidies to consumers buying low-emission vehicles, reducing taxes on EVs and increasing or maintaining taxes on ICE vehicles. But as EVs reach price parity with ICE vehicles, some governments have explored rolling back such incentives; this can have a dramatic and immediate effect on EV sales, as seen by the recent fluctuations in sales in China and the Netherlands. Instead, in light of COVID-19, the need to stimulate total new car purchases has prompted a range of new financial incentives introduced across major markets, some of which clearly favour EVs. For example, in Germany the government has temporarily lowered VAT from 19 per cent to 16 per cent on low-emission vehicles and doubled existing subsidies to almost $7,000 on EVs costing less than $45,000. 25 In France, private consumers who buy electric cars (that cost up to $50,000) now receive an almost $8,000 incentive, up from around $7,000; those looking to get rid of their old cars now receive double the previous value offered by a scrappage scheme, which was designed to get less-efficient models off the road. 26 Under both schemes, a consumer replacing an older car for a new EV could be eligible for up to $13,500. Meanwhile, in China, EV subsidies and tax break policies set to expire in 2020 were extended to 2022 in a direct response to the economic impact of COVID-19. 27 In the long term, the viability of financial incentives will need to be reconsidered as the economic recovery from the pandemic becomes clearer and governments try to manage other concerns, such as potential lost fuel-tax revenues. Factor 3 – OEM vehicle strategy In the past year, some prominent OEMs have announced strategic commitments to EVs (see figure 5). New models have been announced, production targets increased and sales targets moved forward and multiplied. In the short term, COVID-19 may hinder some OEMs in their reach for these targets, as they conserve cash and divert investments elsewhere in the business. But in the long term, we expect these targets to continue as priorities for OEMs. The impact of the investment and targets shown in figure 5 will represent a seismic market shift over the next decade, in terms of availability and affordability of models. Availability of models Recent company announcements have made it clear that there will be substantially more EV models commercially available over the next decade than previously thought. According to statistics cited by the European Federation for Transport and Environment, Europe should expect 33 new models in 2020, 22 in 2021, 30 in 2022 and 33 in 2023. 29 This means that BEV models available in the EU will surpass 100 in 2022 and reach 172 in 2025. In the United States, IHS Markit predicts there will be 130 available models by 2026, offered by 43 brands. 30 Affordability of models Achieving price parity with, or even savings over, ICE vehicles will play a big role in speeding up EV adoption, especially as model ranges and marketing priorities adapt to manufacturer emission targets. A key takeaway from monthly sales figures in 2019 is just how sensitive consumers are to the relative total cost of ownership when it comes to EVs versus ICE vehicles. This includes upfront costs (as seen in the Chinese EV sales drop when subsidies were cut) and short-term costs, like fuel (as seen in the United States, where EV sales dipped right along with fuel prices). Based on recent company announcements, over the next decade we expect to see EVs – particularly BEVs – become available at the low-cost end of the market, but the roll-out of EVs across all parts of the market is likely to be uneven. Even with more OEMs offering affordable EV models, consumers are still unwilling to pay a premium for an EV instead of its ICE equivalent. However, we expect the existing price premium associated with EVs to be consigned to history sooner rather than later. In some cases, the total cost of owning a BEV or PHEV for private buyers is already less than for the ICE equivalent, and the annual cost of ownership is also balancing out. Meanwhile, for businesses and customers that use company car schemes, favourable tax schemes have already created an environment where EVs can offer savings. Factor 4 – The role of corporate companies We are seeing an increasingly important role for corporates to support the transition to EVs, using the three factors highlighted above to their advantage. Sales of new cars to businesses represents a significant proportion of all cars sold. For instance, Deloitte previously predicted that corporates would account for 63 per cent of total new car sales across Western Europe by 2021. 31 In the past year, purpose has continued rising to the top of the corporate agenda, with an increasing number of companies seeking to differentiate themselves by acting as a force for positive change. Because travel is a major avenue for businesses to alleviate emissions, more and more companies are considering how they can support a shift to EVs. Traditional company car schemes are ripe for reinvention: By exploring broader mobility options, businesses are finding value not just in emissions reduction, but in cost savings and improved employee satisfaction. Government tax schemes that target company cars put the emphasis firmly on businesses to lead the way in the shift to EVs. In light of COVID-19, investment in fleets has stalled dramatically as corporates reduce their expenditure and prioritise other investments. Before a comprehensive transition to EVs can take place, business confidence needs to be restored and funds made available again. Corporates also need to consider how fundamental changes to how and where work is done will affect the structure of their mobility schemes. Part 2: New landscape, new approach In our previous report, we identified unprecedented levels of competition that threatened incumbent OEMs as the shift to EVs began taking shape. 32 That threat has reduced somewhat over the past year as those OEMs doubled down on their investment in the sector, and as the reality of competing in the automotive industry hit home for new market entrants. In China, for instance, 486 registered EV manufacturers have raised over $18 billion in funding since 2011, but their collective manufacturing capacity is unsustainable – considering all reasonable sales forecasts. 33 As a result, we expect to see consolidation of the market; some new entrants will fail, and the number of partnerships and joint ventures between Chinese manufacturers and Western OEMs will rise. Outside China, many established OEMs are actually investing in start-ups to take advantage of the capabilities they’ve built. 34 Despite the marginal decline in the threat from new entrants and start-ups, there hasn’t been a consistent speed at which incumbent OEMs have reacted to, and planned for, the growth of EVs. The ability of some manufacturers to swiftly accommodate the future of EVs, and trade in their traditional approaches for creative thinking, means that the competitive landscape will likely re-arrange itself accordingly. Segmenting the market In an increasingly competitive marketplace, all automotive industry stakeholders – established OEMs, new entrants, captive finance houses and dealerships, for example – should consider how they can convince consumers to purchase an EV – or, specifically, their EV. The obvious choices are to ensure current customers remain loyal during the transition from ICE to EV, or to convert new customers to an EV brand or product. A valuable exercise to achieve either objective (or both) is through a refreshed customer segmentation approach: Targeting consumers by their behaviour and needs. In the sections that follow, we’ve used the United Kingdom as a use case for market segmentation, based on Monitor Deloitte’s GrowthPath ® Action Segmentation ® . 35 Although there are significant differences worldwide when it comes to the structure of the automotive industry, the retail market, the readiness for EV adoption and consumer attitudes and behaviours, the principles of segmentation outlined below can be applied to many major markets. For those where they cannot, the central tenet remains true: Refreshing your consumer segmentation approach can benefit EV sales, stimulating the overall growth of the market. Use case: United Kingdom In November 2019 Deloitte conducted a survey of 1,496 United Kingdom residents who are thinking of buying a car in the next three years. More than half of respondents were considering an EV – significantly more than those considering a petrol or diesel car (35 per cent). But their intention doesn’t mean an automatic conversion into purchases. Although sales of EVs in the United Kingdom are rising, BEVs and PHEVs combined still only commanded a 3.1 per cent share of the market in 2019. 36 It’s clear that there is an opportunity here to put consumers under the microscope, discerning certain characteristics that will aid in market segmentation and boost EV conversion. Our goal of meaningful and actionable segmentation begins with the United Kingdom survey results: Based on the opinions of these buyers, we can create a segmentation framework based on driving behaviour and a mix of consumer and demographic variables (see figure 6). In the United Kingdom, the most prominent differences in behaviour and attitudes identified in our survey were determined by how old a consumer is, how much they spend each month and whether they currently own a car or not. Behaviour and attitudes also varied significantly, based on how respondents plan on using their next car and the distances they regularly travel. From the framework, we can see nine potential segments that can categorise future car buyers, all with various meaningful characteristics, behaviours and needs to target and address (see figure 7). To calculate an approximate market size for each segment, a recent industry study offers insight: 56 per cent of adults (17 years and older) believe they will definitely or probably purchase a car in the next three years – a total addressable market of about 30 million people. 38 * Using the annual average GBP/USD exchange rate for 2019, <£299/month = <$382/month and +£300/month = +£383/month Key behavioural differences This kind of segmentation provides a detailed understanding of modern automotive consumers’ needs, wants and behaviours. Before defining the nuances of each United Kingdom segment by creating Customer Portraits®, let’s consider the obvious differences in key behaviours and attitudes: Brand loyalty: Segments E and G are the most brand loyal, usually buying the same brand (47 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, versus the average 27 per cent); this translates to their intended purchasing behaviour – both types of consumer believe they would buy an EV from their current brand (48 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively, versus the average 37 per cent). Segments F and I are most likely to consider switching brands to find a more suitable EV (47 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, versus the average 36 per cent). Segment A is most likely to consider choosing either an EV start-up brand (42 per cent versus the average 25 per cent) or an existing brand not currently associated with automotive products (12 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Research: Segment E is most likely to already know what car they intend to buy prior to researching (50 per cent versus the average 28 per cent). Segment A and Segment I are the least likely to know (40 per cent each versus the average 26 per cent). Ownership benefits: Segment B is the most likely to think environmental reasons are the biggest advantage to EVs (22 per cent versus the average 17 per cent). Segment A considers driving experience to be the biggest advantage (36 per cent versus the average 27 per cent). Price sensitivity: Most segments would pay more for an EV. Segment E is the most likely to pay £100 ($128) or more per month (15 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Segments F and I are the least likely to pay more for an EV (28 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, versus the average 23 per cent). These characteristics are worthy of careful consideration in the next step of the segmentation exercise: building Customer Portraits. Customer Portraits: Driving a change in behaviour Building a Customer Portrait for each target segment invites insights into key aspects of a consumer that, when viewed collectively, explain their behaviour. It outlines what they do and why they do it, identifying the motives for, and barriers to, behavioural change – or lack thereof. Ultimately, this allows an OEM, captive finance company or dealership to effectively target and encourage desired behaviours by revising marketing and activation strategies. A detailed analysis of survey responses and additional qualitative research informs the individual profiles. Each illustrates a typical consumer in a segment, defines their key characteristics, and then uses the distilled information to present ways that persona can be specifically targeted. As an example, we built three Customer Portraits for segments of United Kingdom–based consumers, complete with suggested actions for OEMs. Prioritise to drive purchases Having developed these nuanced Customer Portraits, OEMs and other stakeholders can drill down into the observations to draw conclusions about who is likely to buy what. This will highlight segments to prioritise and where marketing and proposition development budgets can be deployed most effectively. Some segments are naturally more interested in purchasing an EV than others; OEMs and their partners may look to target them first – if the right product mix, capabilities and insight are available to do so effectively. In our United Kingdom example (see figure 8), Segment G is the most likely to consider buying an EV (69 per cent versus the average 50 per cent) – perhaps not surprising, given the relatively higher price tag of EVs up to this point and the greater likelihood of those consumers having off-street parking (77 per cent versus the average 72 per cent). Segment C is also significantly more likely than other segments to consider an EV, but these consumers’ motives seemingly relate to the distance they regularly travel and their awareness of potential ownership savings (e.g., through lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance costs). The impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour Deloitte’s segmentation of the United Kingdom market was performed prior to the emergence of COVID-19. It is important to consider how shifting priorities, in light of the pandemic, may affect the different segments. In the United Kingdom, lockdown measures took consumers out of the automotive retail market for an extended period of time. Even as restrictions are eased, financial concerns may shape how people re-engage with the sector, and to what extent. Lingering health concerns will likely also play a pivotal role in consumer behaviour. Short-term demand for EVs is likely to change, within and across segments. According to consumer research carried out by Deloitte bi-weekly, throughout the pandemic, close to half of United Kingdom consumers now plan to own their current vehicles for longer than originally intended. 42 (The number of consumers aged 18 to 34, or 55 and over, who expressed this sentiment is marginally lower than other age groups.) With work travel being a key component of our segmentation, it is also worth considering how COVID-19 is changing how we travel to and for work. The recent research highlights that over two-thirds of consumers plan to limit their use of public transportation in the future, and well over half plan to limit their use of ride-sharing apps. In the short term, this will likely accelerate demand for cheap second-hand cars, but in the long term this could translate into increased demand for EVs within Segment A. COVID-19 might also prove to be a catalyst for the growth of online sales within different segments. Our COVID-19–related research shows that a fifth of consumers now plan to buy their next vehicle online (if possible). This figure is consistently higher among 18- to 34-year-olds, suggesting that Segments B, C, D and E could all demonstrate a significant jump in demand for online services. Checklist for the journey ahead Ultimately, it’s up to all stakeholders in the automotive industry to consider how they can best serve their prioritised segments. Consumer interest has been sparked, and the onus now lies with new-entry OEMs, captive finance companies, dealerships and, especially, established OEMs to feed the fire. To maximise the opportunities presented by the growing demand for EVs, business leaders in all regions should examine the priorities they have defined according to the segmentation exercise and ask themselves the key questions shown below. The answers may help soften the blow COVID-19 is making on the market and/or aid in the recovery. They’ll also highlight how well-positioned the business is to help accelerate growth in the EV market and reap the benefits when EVs take centre stage. Established OEMs: How well does our existing model range fit the segments we deem high priority, and on which segments should we focus future models? Do we have the right EV supply chains and order-to-delivery capabilities to realise our promises to customers, especially in the initial launch phase? Can we support, or even drive, change in our franchised dealerships by delivering more compelling in-store EV marketing and increasing model availability? How do we make sure that our franchised dealers are aligned with our EV strategy? How can we incentivise them to sacrifice the long-term, recurring profit of an ICE vehicle sale to support the growth of EVs? How well does our current branding support new EV model (and broader proposition) launches? Do we have the right marketing and campaign approaches to target specific segments? Do we have sufficient in-house capabilities, or the right partnerships, to offer a compelling charging proposition? How do we improve our current omni-channel experience? What innovative retail formats, online and bricks and mortar, should we invest in? New-entrant OEMs: Some consumer segments will be identified as ‘easier wins’ to build brand and customer intimacy, so how can our product launch plans target these most effectively? How can new business models, unconstrained by legacy IT systems and physical footprints, provide an enhanced customer experience as compared to traditional OEMs? Will Chinese new entrants need different strategies for launching in Europe? How will we continue to engage with customers after a purchase, to receive product feedback and incorporate it into a refreshed sales strategy? How will we manage the after-sales business without established dealer networks? Are there additional partners that could support market entry and offer a more compelling value proposition, such as energy providers? Captive finance companies: Which financing offers will appeal to which segment? What is the best way to manage the wave of incoming ICE vehicles and realise the expected residuals on these? Which finance solutions will address customers’ apprehension about switching (e.g., combined vehicle and wallbox-charger financing, or social offers, like cinema tickets)? Do we have a compelling offering for our fleet customers to gain regulatory and tax benefits? How can our marketing convincingly address ‘range anxiety’ and other barriers to EV ownership? Do we have the capability to understand and act on existing EV customers’ feedback and learnings to strengthen our retention programmes? Dealerships: Can we effectively communicate the benefits of EVs to our customers? Do we understand which segments want to learn about environmental benefits and which are exclusively interested in technology and performance? Do we have the assets to support a more targeted approach to marketing? Do we offer a financially compelling reason to switch to EVs while maintaining an appropriate margin on the vehicles? Can we fully explain all the available government grants and financial packages available for EVs? Can we offer ongoing maintenance and service packages or deals that include funding for at-home charge points? Is our business set up to handle an increase in online sales? Can we offer collection and delivery services? Can we provide test drives to online customers? Can we use our existing regional footprint to effectively fulfil online sales? Is our business set up to deal with the potential loss of recurring revenue (after-sales service and parts)? Are our marketing and sales strategies fully aligned with those of our OEM partners?

Trends in EV,https://evchargingsummit.com/blog/ev-trends/,10 Electric Vehicle Trends To Watch For in 2023 - EV Charging ...,"10 Electric Vehicle Trends To Watch For in 2023 - EV Charging Summit Blog Skip to the content Search EV Charging Summit Blog Menu Summit & Expo Contact Menu Search Search for: Close search Close Menu Home About Contact Summit & Expo Contact Categories EV Infrastructure 10 Electric Vehicle Trends To Watch For in 2023 As 2022 approaches its end, the world of electric vehicles is buzzing with anticipation for the future advances we expect to come in 2023. While the continued development of existing technologies will drive some of these advances, others may result from innovative new ideas that have yet to hit the market. To help you stay ahead of the curve, here are ten electric vehicle trends to watch for in 2023. 1. Increased Range and Charging Speed Photo by Peter Fazekas Though the electric vehicle market share has continued to grow , it’s been slowed by a handful of factors, most notably the limited range between charges and long waits for EV owners while charging. With advances in battery technology , the average EV will be able to travel further on a single charge than ever before. Additionally, charging times will decrease significantly, making it even easier to keep your EV charged and ready to go. 2. More Affordable And More Available EVs In 2023, we anticipate that more affordable EVs will begin to hit the market, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers. As electric-first vehicle brands continue to grow, the real winners will be consumers previously priced out of the EV market. Many electric vehicles and trucks are due to release in the next year. Examples include the Chevy Equinox EV, around $30,000; the Volkswagen ID.4, starting at $38,000; and the Chevy Silverado electric truck, starting close to $100,000 but could sell for $40,000 by the summer or fall. 3. An Increase in the Number of Used EVs on the Market https://www.pexels.com/photo/vehicles-parked-inside-elevated-parking-lot-63294/ The growth of the primary EV market will also lead to the expansion of the secondhand market as EV owners move on to their second and third cars and put their first purchases back up for sale. 2021 saw sales of more than 40,000 secondhand electric cars, indicating nearly 120% growth over the previous year. As the EV market continues to grow exponentially, we can expect that number to continue to skyrocket. 4. The growth of the sharing economy for EVs The sharing economy already significantly impacts how people live and work, and this impact will continue to grow in the years to come. In 2023, we expect to see the emergence of new sharing economy services that are designed specifically for electric vehicles. Companies like the UK’s JustPark are empowering home charging station owners to rent out their stations to other EV owners, while startups like Envoy are looking to help EV owners rent out their vehicles . As more EVs enter the fray, we can expect more opportunities for those owners to monetize their electric cars and charging stations. 5. Improved Infrastructure for EVs Another exciting trend to watch for in 2023 is improved infrastructure for EVs. One of the challenges EVs currently face is the lack of infrastructure in rural areas; Bloomberg refers to this phenomenon as “ charging deserts .” However, new infrastructure laws aim to provide better access to charging stations across the United States, as state and federal governments recognize that EV sector growth will only be possible with proper investment in infrastructure. 6. The growth of workplace charging stations Photo by Ed Harvey Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have allowed their employees to continue to work at home. However, reports indicate that 9 in 10 companies will require that their employees return to the office in 2023. The rapid growth of EV ownership over the past three years incentivizes companies to provide ample charging stations for their employees. 7. The rise of EV-powered tourism Another sector rebounding from COVID is tourism. As destinations look to lure visitors, they’ll be wise to install meaningful EV infrastructure to ensure that EV owners (or renters) feel comfortable visiting. With $5 billion available for states to improve their EV infrastructure over the next five years, domestic destinations should be well-enabled to brand themselves as EV-friendly destinations. 8. EV Charging Goes Solar Another growing trend in EV charging is solar-powered charging. The growth of residential solar has been exponential over the past decade, and integrating that with vehicle charging could be a game-changer for drivers. Solar-powered chargers have already hit the market, allowing consumers to power their electric vehicles with renewable energy. This shift could be a major competitive advantage for EVs over gas-powered cars if it continues to become more mainstream. 9. An Increase in EV-Related Investment Photo by Pixabay As EVs become more popular, we expect a corresponding increase in investments explicitly devoted to electric vehicles – publicly traded companies are seeing bullish projections for the year ahead. The Environmental Defense Fund projects that EV investment will grow to more than $626 billion by 2030 — and 2023 should be no exception to that long-term growth. 10. The emergence of new EV-specific apps, products, and services In 2023, we expect to see the continued emergence of new apps designed specifically for electric vehicles and charging stations . These apps will provide consumers with a convenient way to access information about EV charging stations, find nearby parking spots, and more.  We also expect to see the development of new products and services tailored to EV owners’ needs, such as subscription-based charging plans and dedicated insurance packages. These trends illustrate just how much potential the EV market holds — and 2023 promises to be a pivotal year as automakers, startups, and governments continue to invest in making EVs more accessible and affordable. We’ll be keeping our eyes open for more developments in the EV space throughout the year. Are you interested in learning more about EV infrastructure trends?

In terms of total market share, EVs jumped from 5% of all new car sales in 2020 to 14% in 2022 , according to the latest Global EV Outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA). This is expected to jump to 18%—nearly one in five—by the end of 2023. One thing is clear: Over the next few decades, electric cars are on course to possibly displace gas-powered vehicles. What once seemed like a futuristic vision is quickly becoming reality, and it can’t come soon enough for a rapidly changing climate. 8 electric vehicle trends in 2023 and beyond What does this mean in the near term? As we look at the rest of 2023 and into the next few years, EV evolution promises to unfold faster than ever before. Here are eight electric vehicle trends to watch in the months and years ahead. 1. China, Europe and the US will continue driving sales Overall, the EIA forecasts that EVs will make up 35% of all global new vehicle sales by 2030, and the big three markets of China, the U.S., and Europe will continue to account for the majority of this transformation. China represents, far and away, the leading EV market . The country accounted for roughly 60% of all EV sales in 2022. It has already surpassed its 2025 target for new energy vehicle sales, and it aims to achieve a 40% sales share for EVs by 2023. China has largely achieved this through over a decade of robust policy support—both nationally and on a provincial level—for early adopters. In Europe, EV sales growth slowed down slightly in 2022, but the market still stands firmly in second place for global EV market share. That’s thanks largely to aggressive vehicle emissions policies that will continue to tighten in the coming years. Electric cars made up 21% of new vehicle sales last year, and this accounted for 25% of EV sales across the globe. The U.S. is still catching up to China and Europe, but EV sales have grown rapidly as of late. In 2022, sales of all U.S. EVs jumped by 55%, with battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales surging by 70%. Overall, the U.S. market was responsible for 10% of global EV sales, driven largely by an expanding, less expensive lineup of available electric cars and tax policies offsetting the costs of purchasing EVs and charging equipment. These three markets are critical to the electrification movement, but they’re not the only ones driving change. EV sales more than tripled in India, Indonesia and Thailand in 2022, driven largely by domestic and international manufacturers investing in new production and growth in those regions. Markets like these will prove essential as the world pushes toward an electrification tipping point. 2. More models (and automakers) will hit the market Over the last few years, automakers have gotten the message that electric cars represent the future of the industry. According to the IEA, there were more than 500 models available in 2022, more than twice the number available in 2019. Although there are still far more gas-powered models available, this EV growth stands in sharp contrast to the slow decline in new gas vehicles. After peaking at around 1,500 models around 2015, gas-powered car models dropped to 1,300 in 2022. This may remain stable, while IEA projections suggest that EV models may at least double over the next few years. This shift is gaining momentum due to established vehicle makers and many new players bringing innovative new models to market. EV startups abound in 2023, and they’re expected to continue shaping the market going forward. 3. Prices will continue to drop As EV technology improves and volume increases, prices continue to drop for both BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs are dropping faster, however, with the average price declining from $71,000 in 2016 to $69,000 in 2023 and continuing toward $68,000 in 2028. Tesla led the way with price drops in 2022, with the price tag for the Model Y dropping below the average cost of all new cars and trucks in the U.S. Several other automakers announced plans for simpler, cheaper EV models in 2023, and this promises to drive costs down further. For many would-be EV owners, these changes are long overdue. In the meantime, however, U.S. policies currently support EV sales with a generous tax credit of up to $7,500 for a new electric car or up to $4,000 for a used EV. Policies like this promise to continue bolstering EV sales growth as some consumers wait for prices to drop. 4. Batteries will improve sharply Range anxiety —the worry that you won’t have enough charge to get to your destination—continues to prevent many drivers from making the switch to electric cars. However, automakers and battery manufacturers are working furiously to take this concern off the table. According to the IEA, venture capital investments in EV and battery technology increased by 30% in 2022, and much of this targeted new battery technology and alternatives to lithium-ion materials. A few top-end EV models have already broken the 400-mile mark for battery range, and many can be charged at impressive speeds . This technology will trickle down to more accessible EVs in the years ahead. 5. Charging will get easier and faster Battery improvements aren’t the only electric vehicle trend addressing range anxiety. Easier, more readily available charging is another key target for policymakers, battery manufacturers, and charging networks. Companies like Enel X Way are investing heavily in improving charging technology and will offer a variety of products to suit different customer needs. DC fast chargers like the JuicePump 175 kW DC fast charger (DCFC) , for example, can take an EV from empty to 80% full in under 20 minutes. That level of charging speed makes long-range drives much more doable. It’s not just about better chargers—drivers also need more of them. In the U.S., policies such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program reflect federal and state commitments to expanding the nation’s charging infrastructure, particularly into rural communities and other underserved areas. The program especially emphasizes the need for Level 3 DCFC at 50-mile intervals along the most frequently traveled 75,000 miles of highway routes across the country. The federal government has provided each state with funds to add chargers along these strategic routes. Individual taxpayers and companies can also access tax credits for purchasing and installing EV charging equipment, making it much easier to charge at home or at work and alleviating any concerns about running out of juice. 6. Chargers will become more standardized In November 2022, Tesla relinguished control of their charging connector the North American Charging Standard and added it to the list of open standards in the EV industry . By eliminating the need for different EV charging plugs , the NACS connector is a step forward in charging accessibiliy. General Motors, Ford , Fisker, Rivian , Polestar , Volvo , Nissan and Mercedes-Benz have all announced their intention to switch their EVs to the NACS plug as late as 2025. Earlier this year, Enel X Way announced that it will support NACS EV charging connectors across its product line of JuiceBoxes and DC fast chargers. These upgrades will offer a unified charging experience for all EV drivers and increase EV adoption and compatibility. 7. Commercial EV adoption will accelerate Commercial vehicles have lagged behind their consumer counterparts in electrification, but there are signs that governments and manufacturers are making this a higher priority. The IEA reports that light-duty commercial EV sales jumped by 90% globally in 2022. Electric buses, along with medium- and heavy-duty trucks, still represent less than 5% of sales in their respective classes, but their share is much larger in markets with a strong commitment to electrifying public transport and reducing emissions. Overall, 27 different governments have pledged to reach 100% zero emissions for public buses and trucks by 2040. The U.S. and European Union have also proposed tighter standards for trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles. With more pressure to electrify vehicles for the public sector and commercial fleets , we’ll see a much higher volume of large EVs hitting the market in the next few decades. 8. Solar energy and EV technology will strengthen the grid Solar energy and electric vehicle charging technology represent more than just an energy-saving solution for consumers. Deployed together, the two can become a powerful solution for decentralizing and strengthening electrical grids. Just as EV production and adoption have grown rapidly with robust policy support over the past decade, so has the solar energy market. These two energy-saving technologies have taken on an almost symbiotic relationship, with solar chargers made for EVs and smart charging technology that allows vehicles to charge at peak sun times when solar energy is readily available. Additionally, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology allows EVs to send excess energy back to the grid, expanding and decentralizing the electrical infrastructure. Coupled with solar, this makes an EV its own kind of solar battery to store extra solar energy that can be used when needed. Utility companies recognize how this technology can reduce costs and decrease strain on the electrical grid, and they’re rightfully offering a variety of incentive programs to make solar panels and EV charging—and the combination of the two—more attractive and affordable. Together, these two technologies can dramatically reduce dependence on fossil fuels while easing the pressure on increasingly strained municipal electrical grids. Charge ahead with Enel X Way These electric vehicle trends only scratch the surface of the exciting EV developments taking place right now.

Trends in EV,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-irresistible-momentum-behind-clean-electric-connected-mobility-four-key-trends,Four key trends in electric cars and mobility | McKinsey,"Four key trends in electric cars and mobility | McKinsey Skip to main content McKinsey Quarterly The irresistible momentum behind clean, electric, connected mobility: Four key trends April 6, 2021 | Article Mobility’s future is visible in the increasing support of capital markets, the demands of Chinese consumers, the effort to slow climate change, and the new skills automakers will need to deal with these shifts. (9 pages) General Motors’ January announcement that it would join other automakers by selling only zero-emission vehicles (in its case, by 2035) was one of the most well-publicized examples of something that has become crystal clear over the past few years: the momentum behind cleaner, software-enabled forms of mobility is powerful and seemingly unstoppable. What does this mean for companies and consumers? In this article, we’ll look at four trends that illustrate the way this new form of transformation will develop: the increasing support of capital markets; the kinds of features these vehicles will have, as seen by the demands of Chinese consumers; the speed needed for this transition to contribute meaningfully to the slowing of climate change; and the impact this shift will have on labor markets. TABLE OF CONTENTS Why capital markets love mobility China’s connected consumer is the future Can electric vehicles put the brakes on climate change? New mobility, new skills Part 1 Why capital markets love mobility by Kersten Heineke , Timo Möller , Asutosh Padhi , Dennis Schwedhelm, and Andreas Tschiesner Over the past year and a half, the mobility industry has significantly outperformed top-performing industries, such as semiconductors and big tech, in capital markets. We think this reflects that new mobility start-ups are doing six key things right: Accessing new value pools. While public attention has focused on autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) that might replace today’s internal-combustion cars, the mobility industry has headed in several promising new directions. Shared mobility, for example, is an industry that could double in size by 2030. Advanced connectivity solutions for EVs, such as personalized contextual advertising based on driving routes, could create a considerable new subscription business, potentially generating up to $310 in revenue and $180 in cost savings per year per car by the end of this decade. Getting software right. We estimate that the automotive software market will have grown by approximately 250 percent by the end of the decade. This will put software at the very center of new automobile designs. Winning the talent war. New mobility requires new kinds of talent. New mobility players in the field are perceived as software- or electronics-first companies and have focused on hiring talent with digital skills from the outset. To catch up, traditional players will have to reskill up to a quarter of their current workforce. Focusing on green. New mobility players have always seen the value of zero-emission vehicles and aim to cut both tailpipe emissions (which account for two-thirds of the total) and emissions from production (the remaining third). The €1.5 billion European Green Vehicles Initiative supports the effort. Consumers factoring sustainability into buying decisions helped drive EV sales up 43 percent in 2020. Focusing on customers. Car buying and maintenance have entered the rapidly growing realm of experience shopping. New mobility players lead with a set of customer-centric solutions that ease the customer journey. It’s not just dedicated apps; there are also social networks, flagship showrooms, and lounges for vehicle owners, creating a pleasing environment that envelops consumers from sales to service upgrades. Offering new purchasing options. Mobility start-ups are giving consumers what they want with the direct purchase of vehicles: 50 percent of consumers across the world’s key markets say they are interested in online car purchases, although less than 5 percent of purchases are made that way now. The absence of a traditional dealer structure allows new mobility players to save up to 25 percent (in dealer margins and incentives) on the price of each car. Traditional dealers see the handwriting on the wall: two-thirds expect that their OEMs will introduce direct sales channels by 2025. 1 Traditional auto companies will compete fiercely to capture a healthy portion of these new value pools. Hybrids and EVs have been part of their portfolios for a long time now, and they are rapidly accelerating their efforts to win subscription revenue and think software-first. Whether those efforts are enough for capital markets to reward them too remains an open question.

Part 2 China’s connected consumer is the future by Paul Gao , Florian Garms, Asad Husain , and Philipp Kampshoff If you’re a Chinese owner of an electric car, your experience is significantly different from that of most Western electric-car owners. In fact, your experience inside the car is in many ways just an extension of your experience outside the car. New Chinese automakers have tapped into advanced technologies to deliver a customer journey that is friendly and convenient, starting with online sales, which are the norm in China. But the experience is truly differentiated when you climb into the driver’s seat. Advanced facial-recognition systems using in-vehicle cameras kick in immediately, adjusting the seat, steering wheel, and interior lighting to your preferred settings. A customized avatar on the central dashboard screen greets you and even offers up restaurant recommendations if you say that you’re looking for someplace to eat. If you want to change the music during your drive, just say so. Chinese automakers have also improved on charging and parking: valet charging services will drive the car to a charging station during your work hours and return it to your parking spot before your commute home. And if you do have to charge the car yourself, you can pay for it from the infotainment screen, which has many of the features and apps that you get on your smartphone. 2 These developments may not seem as significant as, say, electrification itself. But they have the potential to be hugely significant. Chinese consumers are willing to pay twice as much as their Western peers for such features. Electrification may eventually become the expected norm, just as gasoline-powered engines did. But connected, consumer-friendly features have the potential to woo customers—in China, 56 percent of consumers say they’d be willing to change brands for better connectivity. OEMs around the world would be wise to pay attention to that statistic. It may well be that the differentiating feature in the car of the future will be its ability to mimic the conveniences we’ve come to expect from our smartphones.

Part 3 Can electric vehicles put the brakes on climate change? by Julian Conzade, Russell Hensley , and Patrick Schaufuss Despite 2020 being a tipping-point year for EV sales, automakers and consumers will need to accelerate their adoption if we hope to meaningfully limit climate change. Reducing carbon emissions from vehicles is critical—currently, road transport accounts for 13 percent of global carbon emissions. To understand the depth of the challenge, consider that the pace of technology development of mobility is already quite fast. The cost of EV batteries, for example, is now just $100 per kilowatt-hour, down from $1,200 in 2010. Investment in EV-related technologies and assets almost doubled in 2020. And yet these advancements still aren’t enough to ensure that we’ll hit the 1.5°C climate targets. The decade between 2025 and 2035 will determine whether the industry can keep cumulative CO 2 emissions for passenger cars (through 2050) to under 45 gigatons, a “carbon budget” that would help hold global temperature increases to under 1.5°C , according to McKinsey analysis. Mobility players, consumers, and governments face five challenges: Speed the shift to zero-emission vehicles. This is the most efficient lever to reduce carbon emissions. By 2035, more than 95 percent of all cars and trucks on the road would need to be zero-emission vehicles to limit warming to 1.5°C. Leverage the abatement potential of transition technologies. Hybrid vehicles and more efficient gas-powered cars can play an important role in the transition to a zero-emission global vehicle fleet. Reduce vehicle miles traveled. While trends like increased hours of remote work may help reduce vehicular travel, governments may need to explore the traffic optimization potential of multimodal mobility. Increase share of renewables. Clean electricity and low-carbon fuels (eg, renewable natural gas) are needed to reduce the life cycle emission of road transport. Zero-carbon supply chains. OEMs will also turn their attention to supply chains. How can materials, their transport, and in-plant processes become carbon free? There are a number of promising efforts, like the development of “green” steel, and the location of battery plants close to OEMs to lower carbon transport costs. Some such plants are even powered with carbon-free, water-generated electricity. 3 None of this will be easy. Holding emissions under the 45 gigaton target will require a cross-industry effort among companies, industries, and government. For instance, the energy and transport sectors can work together to drive smart-charging technologies that would in turn accelerate the shift to EVs. Coalitions can be formed to develop clean supply chains for the creation of low-carbon battery solutions that reflect the full potential of a circular economy. Ultimately, regulators and policy makers may have to intercede, adopting an ecosystem perspective with cross-border goals and meaningful timelines for everything from number of charge points needed to the trajectory of carbon reduction. Without this kind of cooperation, it’s unlikely that the shift to EVs will realize its full potential for creating a sustainable battery value chain and for mitigating the impact of climate change.

Part 4 New mobility, new skills by Björn Hagemann , Ruth Heuss , and Kirsten Weerda Over the next five to ten years, the skill sets of traditional automakers and suppliers will need to shift dramatically. Several factors will drive this change. The rising importance of in-vehicle software and connected and autonomous cars increases the need for digital talent, putting OEMs worldwide in direct competition with Silicon Valley and the Chinese digital giants. But the shift isn’t merely an issue of seeking out new kinds of engineers. Drawing from thousands of existing databases, we created a taxonomy of the future skills the industry will need. Based on that work, we believe that demand for workers with today’s standard skill sets will drop by up to 30 percent in the coming decade. A reduction of employees could occur across the entire automotive value chain. As consumers become increasingly comfortable buying everything online, existing dealer networks could shrink dramatically and shift their focus to maintenance. Manufacturing could take a similar hit, driven mostly by OEMs shifting to EVs with simpler assembly processes and very different parts. Both factory workers and current powertrain suppliers will be affected. Existing large-scale combustion-engineering departments will no longer be needed after 2030—EVs require engineers with more electrical skills and an understanding of battery chemistry. As with many other industries, up to 50 percent of some support-function tasks, such as accounting or order processing, are likely to be fully automated. And for those tasks that can’t be automated, we may see the creation of shared service centers in low-cost locations, now that companies are more skilled at using digital tools and more comfortable with remote work because of the pandemic. New skills will be needed, especially in software and data analytics, which will be critical for online sales and marketing channels. We believe automakers can close up to half of the skills gap organically, by way of reskilling, continuous education, and hiring. M&A and strategic partnerships, already a core aspect of the mobility ecosystem, will also play a big role. Every automaker needs a strategic workforce plan that identifies critical roles and skills at every level in the organization, and matches the right talent to the most value-creating roles. This would be a big shift from the traditional succession and talent management processes of OEMs, which have focused on the top tiers of the company. 4 This skills transformation will demand a culture transformation as well. Automakers will have to provide the kind of employee experience that top talent has come to expect at tech companies, which means approachable managers, speedy hiring and onboarding, agile-work and fast-decision processes using QBRs [quarterly business reviews] and OKRs [objectives and key results] methodologies, compensation and incentives tied to talent rather than hierarchy, and an acceptance of flexible and remote work. All in all, the changes to the automotive workforce are likely to be as extensive as the changes coming to the vehicles they manufacture.

Historical data 2. Global EV market 3. Other electric vehicles 4. EV charging 5. Technological development 6. The environmental impact of EVs 7. EV-related policies 8. EVs & the private sector 9. 2030 (and beyond) forecasts The global electric vehicle market share has taken a tremendous leap forward in the past decade, and we expect the trend to only accelerate in the coming years. Even though we’ve already seen some incredible growth in the number of EVs worldwide, the EV industry predictions suggest that we’ve only just scratched the surface . 1. Historical data oN the global EV market To understand the current situation of the EV sector, let’s look at what happened in the past couple of years. The year 2020 did not show a significant growth in overall new car registrations. The global market for all types of cars was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn that followed. Amid the pandemic, the outlook for global EV sales was quite unpredictable at the beginning of the year. However, as time showed, 2020 turned out to be a surprisingly positive year, with global EV sales growing by 43% from 2019 and the global electric car industry market share rising to a record 4,6% in 2020. The year 2021 was a major leap forward for electric vehicle sales. Sales of electric vehicles doubled from 202 0 to 6.75 million. The number of EVs sold in a week in 2021 was higher than how many were sold in the whole year of 2012. While we’re heading in the right direction, the road to full electrification is still long — but it’s becoming a reality. 2. Global electric car market share and size EVs are to play a central role in the ambitious objective of zero-emission targets set for 2050 , and the industry is gearing up for it. The year 2022 came on strong, breaking records . EV sales exceeded 10 million , with 14% of all new cars sold being electric , quite the jump from 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. That resulted in more than 26 million electric cars roaming global roads in 2022 , representing a 60% uptake from 2021. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 The market is growing. It’s growing fast. And it’s growing everywhere. Carried by a decarbonisation challenge most leading nations now take seriously and supported by various policies and incentives , global EV sales keep accelerating in 202 3 . 2.3 million EVs were sold only in the first quarter of the year. That is 25% more than in the same time in 2022. We're predicted to see 14 million in sales by the end of 2023 . Electric cars could account for 18% of total car sales by then. Source: EV volumes How's the situation in Europe? Europe experienced a downturn in EV sales in 2022 compared to the exceptional growth seen in 2020 and 2021. But the continent still remained 2 nd largest market for electric vehicles . Electric car sales were more than 15% higher compared to 2021 and reached 2.7 million. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 Despite the downturn, the continent’s EV sales continue to increase steadily, reflecting the recent implementation of stricter rules regarding CO2 emission standards, such as the mandated 100% reduction in CO2 emissions for new cars and vans from 2035. Not to mention, EV sales growth can also be attributed to stimulus measures introduced by many European governments and various tax benefits and subsidies put in place in major markets. Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany remain to be the largest European markets , according to the 2023 Global EV Outlook by IEA. 3. The state of other electric vehicles While passenger cars typically get all the credit for the EV revolution, it’s good also to consider other forms of transportation that are gradually becoming greener. From public transportation to e-scooters: The entire transportation industry is turning electric Light commercial vehicles (LCV) In 2022, the sales share of electric LCVs was higher than that of passenger EVs for the first time. Electric LCVs saw tremendous growth in 2022 as sales increased by over 90%, even though the overall LCV sales declined. Worldwide, there were about 310 000 electric LCVs in 2022. As more electric LCV models enter the market and commercial customers become aware of the ‘reduced cost’ benefit of electric LCVs, we expect the market to only accelerate in the future. Heavy-duty trucks Almost 60 000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks were sold worldwide in 2022. As m any truck manufacturers strive for an all-electric future , the number of commercially available zero-emission truck models has expanded in 2022. The market offers over 840 models by more than 100 OEMs. The electrification of the heavy-duty sector is a crucial part of the journey to a zero-emission future because even though they only account for 10% of all ICE vehicles, they are responsible for 70% of ICE CO2 emissions. Governments are well aware, and various countries are pledging to achieve 100% zero-emission truck sales by 2040. In 2022, the US and the EU proposed higher emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Buses Electric buses have been growing in popularity since 2020. In 2022, almost 66 000 electric buses were sold globally. China dominated the market, accounting for over 80% of global electric bus sales. The country also excels in manufacturing electric buses and is a major exporter to Latin American, North American and European countries. In the European Union countries, the Clean Vehicles Directive provides targets for public procurement of electric buses. France, Germany, and Spain are only a few EU countries witnessing increased electric bus sales. In 2022, Finland saw Europe's highest sales share of electric buses. Electric bus sales accounted for more than 65% there. Two and three-wheelers Historically, China dominated the electric two-wheeler market and continued to do so in 2022 despite sales dropping from over 10 million in 2021 to less than 7.7 million in 2022. This drop can be explained by supply chain challenges following the Covid-19 pandemic. In terms of electric three-wheelers, India leads the race with 425 000 units sold in 2022. Together with China, where almost 350 000 three-wheelers were sold in 2022, these two countries accounted for nearly 99% of global sales. 4. The state of EV charging Most charging still happens at home or work , but the more electric vehicles roaming the roads, the more public charging points are needed to support the wide EV uptake . In 2022, there were 2.7 million public charging points globally. 900 000 of these were installed over the year, accounting for 55% growth from 2021. For both slow AC charging and fast DC charging, China dominated the market in 2022. During the year, 360 000 slow and almost 297 000 fast charging points were installed in China. And how about Europe? In 202 2 , we counted over 450 000 publicly available EV chargers in Europe . By 2025, it's estimated that 1.3 million charging stations will be publicly accessible , and the number should grow to 2.9 million by 2030. The Netherlands takes the lead in deploying EV charging infrastructure, followed by France and Germany. Italy and Spain also make it to the top 5, with Spain's public charging infrastructure growing by 223% in 2022 compared to the previous year. S ource: Power2Drive Europe based on European Alternative Fuels Observatory EAFO EV charging trends Fast(er) chargers make longer journeys much more comfortable and might be a reason for those without private charging access to buy an electric vehicle. They are the most efficient way to fight range anxiety (or how far one can go with an EV before having to stop and recharge). In Europe, slow chargers are being replaced by fast and ultra-fast chargers . In 202 2 , the number of fast chargers was up by more than 55 % and reached almost 7 0 000 units. The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) , revised in the first quarter of 2023, sets requirements for EV charging coverage across Europe. This regulation highlights the ambition to develop public charging infrastructure across the continent further. For example, the EU’s Member States need to make sure there is a fast-charging pool every 60 km in each direction of travel by 2025 along the main European routes . Another trend that’s steadily increasing in the EV space is the smart charging of electric vehicles , i.e. the use of cloud-connected charging devices. For business owners and consumers alike, smart EV charging allows — among other things— greater convenience and control over electricity consumption. Lastly, we can't mention EV charging trends without acknowledging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) . V2G technology makes it possible to transfer the electricity stored in electric vehicle batteries back to the grid in the same way stationary storages are connected to the grid. V2G services are already commercially available, and several charger manufacturers can supply V2G chargers. The V2G market is projected to grow to over €4,5 billion by 2024. The European standard for V2G charging, ISO 15118-20 , developed back in 2020, defines the requirements for bidirectional charging. Virta has been recognised as one of the global leaders in V2G technology. Want to learn more about V2G and smart charging? Read our quick guide on bi-directional charging. → Learn more here And for even more information about smart charging (including the definition, benefits, practical how-tos, and more), take a look at our comprehensive Smart Charging guide! 5. The development of electric vehicle & charging technology Another interesting perspective relates to developing new EV parts and charging technologies. The increase in electric car registrations resulted in an increased production of automotive lithium-ion batteries. In 2022, EV battery demand increased by 65% from the previous year as EV sales continued to grow in all markets , especially in China . The battery demand increase can be attributed to the growing sales of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which require batteries larger in size as opposed to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). China remains the leading country for battery production , specifically heavy-duty battery production. However , Europe is not staying behind. According to BloombergNEF, Europe’s share of global battery production could rise to 31% by 2030. It's clear that to support the growing demand for electric vehicles, the various elements of the EV battery supply chain will have to increase, from the extraction of raw materials such as lithium or nickel to the EV production itself. A variety of developments in battery characteristics, driven by high demand, will provide multiple benefits to the EV business. For the EV market, further technological advances include: changes in battery chemistry changes in energy density changes in the size of battery packs Ultimately, these changes will lead to cost reductions and increased production efficiency. Several EV manufacturing plants plan to expand their electric car production capacity because of increased policy support. This is good news for the market at large since it means that the supply of EVs will be able to catch up with the demand. And if that wasn’t enough, we’re also working on some exciting stuff here at Virta. For example, our proprietary Plug&Charge feature allows our customers to identify themselves directly by connecting their vehicles to a charger. No pin codes, RFID tags, or credit cards are necessary. 6. The environmental impact of EVs Altogether EVs consumed approximately 110 terawatt-hours of electricity in 202 2 , doubling from the previous year . In the future, EVs are projected to account for less than 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030. As the electricity demand for charging electric vehicles grows, the need to protect the electricity grid grows with it. Careful planning of electricity infrastructure, the widespread use of smart charging and the implementation of smart energy management solutions for load management will all be crucial to ensure healthy and balanced power systems. In 2022, EV use saved more than 80 million tonnes of GHG emissions EVs globally. In practice, all EV emissions are born due to the manufacturing process, while we can’t apply similar logic to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. In the grand scheme of things, it’s safe to conclude that the public debate over EVs vs ICE cars’ environmental impact is turning in favour of EVs. Future predictions based on the Stated Policies Scenario say that in 2030, using EVs could help avoid 70 0 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of GHG emissions . The Announced Pledges Scenario takes this number even further, predicting over 770 Mt of CO2-eq. Are electric vehicles (really) green? We debunked a lot of the misinformation circulating about EVs and what it takes to produce them. Read it here — Myth buster: Electric vehicles are not green . While it’s true that EVs increase electricity consumption, that can become the saving grace of energy utilities in the future. By the 2040s, electric vehicles will add up to over 30 TWh of installed battery storage capacity. For utilities, this means that EVs offer cheap energy storage, with no capital cost and relatively low operating costs. 7. The current EV-related policies It’s no secret that governmental and local policies play a huge role in accelerating EV adoption. In 2022, EV-related policies accounted for over 90% of global LDV sales and 70% of HDV and two/three-wheeler sales. Major markets (China, the US, Europe) currently seeing rapidly growing EV sales began their EV journeys by introducing policies like vehicle purchase incentives. These markets are now shifting from incentivising the sales of electric cars towards supporting heavy-duty transportation and EV charging. Example: The United Kingdom The country stopped subsidising the sales of electric cars and dedicated GBP 1.6 billion to growing the public charging infrastructure. It's expected that 300 000 public chargers will be installed in the country by 2030. EV-related policies are crucial in driving countries towards their electrification targets. While some countries strive for 100% electrified sales, others plan to ban the sales of ICE vehicles completely. Let's take a closer look at the varying electrification targets of countries globally and their timeline. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 8. The private sector’s response to EVs The private sector, and car manufacturers, in particular, have responded positively to the ongoing changes in the market. Many car manufacturers have announced electrification of their fleets either partially or fully. Let's look at some of the major automakers' electrification targets. Source: Global EV Outlook 2023 On the fleet side, EV100 , a global initiative supporting the switch to zero-emission transportation with its 130 members, is committed to switching to electric and installing charging infrastructure for employees and customers by 2030. To list a few examples, Unilever pledges to transition its fleet of more than 11 000 vehicles to electric and install workplace EV charging for their staff. ABB also plans to switch to electric for their 11 000 fleet vehicles. But it's not only the companies that are part of EV100 introducing ambitious pledges. DHL has pledged to reach 70% clean operations of last-mile pick-ups and deliveries by 2025. And DB Schenker wants to make its transport activities in European cities emission-free by 2030. While actions like these are worthy of attention on their own, their fringe benefit is that they act as signalling devices for the rest of the market. In other words, public pledges like these pressure competitors and stakeholders to act faster than they otherwise would have. 9. Forecasts: EV market outlook by 2030 and beyond When it comes to the future, according to the Global EV Outlook 2023 , there are three possible scenarios: The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) suggests that by 2030, the global electric vehicle stock (excluding two/three-wheelers) will reach nearly 240 million vehicles and account for over 10% of the global vehicle fleet. According to a bit more ambitious scenario, the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) , almost 250 million EVs will be roaming global roads by 2030, and EV sales will represent over 35% of all vehicle sales. Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) predicts that the global EV stock will reach 380 million EVs, with EV sales climbing up to 60% of all vehicle sales in 2030. What about Europe? The next few years will be crucial for Europe to secure its leading status. We expect to reach a first milestone of 14 million EVs by 2025. After that, low estimates mention 33 million EVs by 2030, while high estimates talk about 40 million EVs roaming around Europe at the same time . From 2035 onwards, we expect 100 % of new cars sold in Europe to be electric. Of course, only time (and new data) will tell us if those predictions are to become realities. However, the latest trends are heading in the right direction. In other words, the time businesses embark on the EV train is now!

Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November. Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. Most automakers posted sizeable gains over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. In Q3, 14 new EV models that did not exist one year ago were in the mix, including Chevrolet Blazer and Silverado EVs. (The new Chevy EVs had very low sales – just an initial few to mark a Q3 launch). The EV market is transforming, to be sure. Electric vehicle sales accounted for 7.9% of total industry sales in Q3, a record and up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% in Q2. As Cox Automotive has been reporting, higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the U.S. market. EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters. EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. The long-promised Cybertruck may reverse the downward trend, although competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet will likely impact Tesla’s electric pickup volume potential. The German luxury makes – Audi, BMW, and Mercedes – continue to rapidly increase sales of EV models. In Q3, BMW and Mercedes EV sales more than triple year-ago levels, while Audi posted an EV sales gain of 94%. Among automakers selling internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV products, Audi, BMW and Volvo had the richest mix of EVs in Q3. BMW had the highest proportion, with over 15% of its sales being EVs, followed by Audi and Volvo, with over 12% of their sales being EVs, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. Mercedes, Porsche and VW all had an EV mix in excess of 10% last quarter. Q3 EV SHARE OF TOTAL BRAND SALES In 2020, just three years back, EV sales in the U.S. passed 250,000 for the first time. This year, the market will jump past 1 million. In Q3, Tesla remains the undisputed leader in EV sales, with Ford a distant #2 on the list, selling just over 20,000 EVs. Most analysts expect a flood of new EVs in the coming three years, with the number of available EV products likely to double by 2027. With this changing landscape, EV sales volume growth in the U.S. is expected to continue. Of late, product availability has grown exponentially, while consumer acceptance has grown in a more linear fashion. Those trends will likely continue, making for some very interesting market dynamics in the years ahead. Change is never easy.

Related Articles - Cold weather range loss and EVs: Separating fact from fiction - Carrier Transicold launches all-electric refrigeration unit - Recycled Rubber Coalition white paper examines EV impact on scrapped tires Advanced Li-ion battery cells & packs Advanced Li-ion refers to silicon and Li-metal anodes, solid-electrolytes, high-Ni cathodes and various cell design factors. Given the importance of the electric vehicle market, specifically battery electric cars, in determining battery demand, IDTechEx says it believes Li-ion is forecast to maintain its dominant position. However, gradual improvements to cathodes, anodes, cell design and energy density are key. According to the recent IDTechEx report, “ Electric Cars 2023-2043 ,” up to 400Wh per kg battery cells will be in mainstream markets by 2030. Innovation is also happening at the pack level. Several materials are required to assemble a battery pack, including thermal interface materials, adhesives, gaskets, impregnation, potting, fillers and more. A general trend towards larger cell form factors and non-modular cell-to-pack battery designs is underway, reducing the number of connections, busbars and cables between cells and modules. Power electronics In automotive power electronics (inverters, onboard chargers, DC-DC converters), key advancements are being made to improve powertrain efficiency, allowing for either battery pack capacity reduction or improved range. One of the key avenues to achieving greater efficiencies is the transition to silicon carbide MOSFETs and high-voltage vehicle platforms at or above 800V. Indeed, Renault, BYD, GM, Hyundai and others have announced 800V vehicle platforms that will adopt silicon carbide MOSFETs in their power electronics through 2025. IDTechEx says the transition presents fresh challenges for power module package materials, as higher switching frequencies, increased power densities and increased operational temperatures are demanded, all while maintaining a 15-year service life. The report finds that 800V platforms and SiC inverters will rise to at least 10% of the market by 2030. As the power density of semiconductor chips increases exponentially, new double-sided cooling designs, copper wire bonds and lead frames will enable the trend. Electric motors Electric motor markets are still evolving with new designs improving power and torque density and more considerations around the materials used. IDTechEx believes developments such as axial flux motors and various OEMs may eliminate rare earth materials altogether. There are several key performance metrics for electric motors. Power and torque density enables improved driving dynamics in a smaller and lighter package, with weight and space at a premium in EVs. Another critical area is drive-cycle efficiency. Improving efficiency means less of the precious energy stored in the battery is wasted when accelerating the vehicle, leading to an improved range from the same battery capacity. Due to the many different considerations in motor design, the EV market has adopted several other solutions, including permanent magnet, induction and wound-rotor motors. IDTechEx thinks that while motors will remain dominated by permanent magnets, there will be opportunities for magnet-free variants as cost and sustainability come to the forefront in the coming years. Fuel Cells Opportunities for fuel cells in car markets are limited, although markets are still growing, underpinned by government support. The deployment of fuel cells within vehicles is not a new concept. Major OEMs, including Toyota, Ford, Honda, GM, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW, have invested large sums over the past 30 years in advancing the technology. For passenger cars, a considerable amount of effort and expense has gone into developing fuel cells. Still, in 2022 only two major OEMs, Toyota and Hyundai, have FCEV cars in production and fewer than 20,000 FCEVs were sold in 2021. Fuel cell vehicle deployments face considerable challenges, including decreasing the cost of fuel cell system components and rolling out sufficient hydrogen refueling infrastructure. Also essential will be the availability of low-cost ‘green’ hydrogen, produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity, which analysis in the new IDTechEx report highlights will be vital to FCEVs delivering the environmental credentials on which they are being sold. Autonomy ‘Autonomous vehicle’ (AV) is an umbrella term for the six levels defined by the SAE. Today, most new cars are arriving with the option of level 2 functionality and the industry is technically ready for level 3 once regulatory hurdles clear. In recent years, vast improvements to autonomous vehicle technologies such as radar, lidar, HD cameras and software have propelled ‘Robo-Taxis’ to the cusp of market readiness. In certain scenarios, level 4 autonomy is commercialized in 2022, with Cruise and Baidu introducing initial services in the US and China, respectively. IDTechEx forecasts how these services will come to dominate within 20 years. Overall, IDTechEx reports autonomous vehicles becoming a massively disruptive technology that will proliferate at a rate of up to 47% to transform the auto market over the next two decades.

With advancements in technology, increasing environmental consciousness, and supportive government policies, EVs have gained significant traction as a viable and sustainable transportation option. As concerns over climate change and air pollution intensify, consumers and industries are increasingly turning to electric vehicles to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a greener future. This growing global momentum has propelled the EV market into a transformative phase, with innovations and investments driving the expansion of EV adoption across the world. To know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report To know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure Electric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics: Driver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective Due to technological advancements and the production of EV batteries on a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade. Restraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure The initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time. Opportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors Increase in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022. Challenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE) The high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles. Market Ecosystem FCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period The FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. Mid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period A mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022. Thus, the demand for mid-priced EVs has been high in the past few years and is expected to keep rising in the coming decade. The market in the MEA is expected to grow at the highest rate in this segment as there is expected to be rising new demand in this region for these vehicles in the next decade. Asia Pacific to be the largest and the fastest growing market by value during the forecast period The region is home to some of the fastest-developing economies, such as China and India. The governments of these emerging economies have recognized the growth potential of the EV Market trends and, hence, have taken different initiatives to attract major OEMs to manufacture electric vehicles in domestic markets. The region is home to 93 of the world’s most polluted cities, and has a high energy demand. As of 2022, transportation sector in the region accounts for around 14% of overall emissions. Thus, countries in the region, are planning to reduce emissions in the coming years. China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022. The demand of Mini-EVs has been growing in the country, with more choices available with other leading Chinese manufacturers entering the mini-EV space. Luxury EVs have also increased in demand in the country, with major domestic OEMs in China have grabbed the EV Market share.

19.5 RELATED REPORTS 19.6 AUTHOR DETAILS The study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments. Secondary Research In the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market. Primary Research Extensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews. In the canvassing of primaries, we have strived to cover various departments within organizations, such as sales, operations, and administration, to provide a holistic viewpoint in our electric vehicle market report. After interacting with industry experts, we conducted brief sessions with highly experienced independent consultants to reinforce the findings from our primaries. This, along with the in-house subject matter experts’ opinions, has led us to the findings as described in the remainder of this report. Following is the breakdown of primary respondents. To know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure Market Size Estimation The bottom-up approach was used to estimate and validate the total market size. This method was also used extensively to estimate the size of various subsegments in the market. The research methodology used to estimate the market size includes the following: The key players in the industry and markets have been identified through extensive secondary research The industry’s supply chain and market size, in terms of volume, have been determined through primary and secondary research processes All percentage shares, splits, and breakdowns have been determined using secondary sources and verified through primary sources To know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report Market Size Validation The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the electric vehicle market by drive type and top speed in terms of volume. The top-down approach has been used to estimate and validate the size of the EV Market. In this approach, key drive and top speeds of electric vehicles are identified for each propulsion type (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) at the country-level. The penetration of each identified drive type and top speed type for each propulsion type is multiplied with the volume of each vehicle at the country-level to derive the total volume. All country-level data is summed up to derive the global market by drive and top speed type. Data Triangulation After arriving at the overall market size—using the market size estimation processes as explained above—the market was split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the overall market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation, and market breakdown procedures were employed, wherever applicable. The data was triangulated by studying various factors and trends from both the demand and supply sides.

According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance , total global electric vehicle sales went from approximately 3.2 million in 2020 to 10.3 million in 2022 . The firm predicts more than 13 million EV sales in 2023 and exponential growth in the coming years—as many as 20 million EV sales in 2025. Global sales of commercial EVs also more than doubled in 2021 and Bloomberg reports that large global truck makers expect 35 to 60 percent of their annual sales to be electric trucks by 2025. EV charging infrastructure is growing as well. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), there were nearly 1.8 million public charging points worldwide in 2021. Nearly 500k chargers were installed globally just in that same year. According to the IEA, the average annual fast charger deployment growth rate in 2021 was 48 percent. BloombergNEF estimates that between now and 2040 the growing global EV fleet will require between 340 and 490 million chargers to stay on the road. The firm also predicts that the cumulative global investment in global charging infrastructure will exceed $1 trillion between today and 2040. They estimate that fast chargers will deliver 50 percent of EV energy demand and will account for 60% of total charging investment. There is undoubtedly a huge push to build global DC fast charging networks. The US government is providing more than $5 billion in funding and incentives to build a coast-to-coast fast charging network, and many countries in Europe are rolling out similar programs to spur EV charging infrastructure growth. 2023 will be a big year for EVs and EV charging, but there’s more to the story. In this article we’ll explore some trends and predictions for the EV and EV charging industry in 2023 and beyond. National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program On February 15, 2023, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Biden Administration announced standards for chargers purchased and installed with NEVI funding. These include: Predictable charging: Consistent plug types, power levels, and a minimum number of chargers capable of supporting drivers’ fast charging needs Reliability requirements: 97% uptime reliability requirement Accessible charging: Publicly accessible data on charging locations that include price, availability, and accessibility through mapping applications Single ID: A single method of identification that works across all chargers Plug & Charge capability: All NEVI chargers must support Plug & Charge. Chargers used in NEVI projects must also meet Buy America standards: Assembly: Charging equipment enclosures must be assembled in the US. Steel components: All steel components in charging equipment enclosures must be made in the US. This includes all manufacturing processes for these enclosures, from melting and pouring through the final application of coatings. Domestic content: Beginning July 1, 2024, 55% of the components (by cost) used in charging equipment must meet Build America, Buy America Act standards. Any equipment that does not meet this standard must be installed no later than October 1, 2024. Tritium will soon announce the company’s NEVI solution, which is expected to meet all the requirements outlined by the FHWA and the Biden Administration, and will be built in our new Tennessee facility. NEVI is accelerating EV charging infrastructure rollout in the US, but we’re just at the beginning of the exponential growth curve. Many states are just getting started with their NEVI programs and most won’t be ready to install chargers until later in 2023. We predict that NEVI chargers will start to be deployed en masse in 2024. Faster High-Speed Charger Growth in Norway and Germany Norway proudly proclaims that it’s the EV capital of the world—for good reason. In 2022, 73% of new cars sold in Norway were EVs and the country plans to transition its entire fleet to EVs by 2025. The country is fueling the transition with a combination of incentives and taxes on fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. Norway is expanding its DC fast charging network to keep up with its growing EV fleet. The country of 5.3 million people has more than 18k public charging stations total and more than 5k DC fast charging stations. That gives the country one of the highest ratios of EVs to charging stations in the world. Demand for DC fast chargers remains steady in Norway, and the country is installing the fastest-available chargers along highway corridors to facilitate longer trips with EVs and electric trucks. We anticipate that Norway will continue to build out its charging networks, upgrading low-speed chargers with high-speed DC fast chargers in 2023. Germany also saw rapid growth in EV charging infrastructure in 2022. The number of public charging stations grew from around 25k to 30k over the course of the year. Most of those were DC fast charging stations. Germany has approximately 13,192 kilometres (8,197 mi) of Autobahn (highways), where DC fast charging is key to crossing the country in short timeframes. German automakers have been at the forefront of fast charging, producing some of the fastest-charging cars in the world. Volkswagen (VW), the world’s largest automaker in 2022, released a series of EVs under its brands VW and Audi in 2022 capable of DC fast charging. The flagship Audi e-tron GT is capable of charging at a maximum rate of 270kW and most VW EVs charge at a maximum 120kW rate. DC fast chargers will be key for German EV owners and many charging stations in Germany have already upgraded to ultra-fast 350kW-plus DC chargers. Both countries will also be deploying more heavy freight electric trucks, which have large-capacity battery packs and can especially benefit from 350kW-plus charging. We anticipate Germany and Norway leading the charge to 350kW DC fast chargers in 2023. Further Fleet Electrification In 2022 many companies began electrifying their fleets. Walmart purchased 4 , 500 Canoo Electric Delivery Vehicles (EDVs) and reserved 5k GM BrightDrop electric vans for last-mile deliveries. The company also trialed Freightliner eCascadia and Nikola heavy electric trucks for larger deliveries. Amazon also recently rolled out a fleet of Rivian electric trucks to 100 cities across the US and plans to eventually deploy 100,000 electric trucks for deliveries. The United States Post Office is also going electric , promising to spend nearly $10 billion on a fleet of more than 60k EVs by 2028. In Europe, Amazon is also planning to spend €1 billion to electrify its delivery fleet. Many other companies are already switching to electric delivery vehicles to reduce noise and air pollution in cities. In early 2023, Germany opened up its first electric truck corridor designed specifically for heavy freight vehicles. The 600-km (373-mile) stretch of the Rhine-Alpine corridor across Germany has six charging locations that feature ultra-fast 300kW charging specifically for heavy trucks. Swedish truck maker Volvo also started delivering their heavy freight EV, the VNR electric, across the world. The truck gets a range of 440km (275 miles) from its massive 565kWh battery and is capable of easily hauling heavy loads long distances. Many rideshare fleets are also going electric or partially electric. US-based rideshare company Revel is fully electric and in Europe Uber has teamed up with Hertz to make 25k EVs available to rideshare drivers. Uber also says that nearly 50k drivers in the US have rented a Tesla through the program and have completed more that 24 million fully electric trips. Uber plans all of its trips to be “zero emissions” under its Green Program by the end of the decade. US rideshare company Lyft has also vowed to go 100% electric by 2030 . Tritium has received orders for DC fast chargers from fleet operators around the globe and we anticipate more fleets will continue to transition to electric in 2023. 800v Batteries Mean Ultrafast Charging Many EVs have relied on 400v battery architecture, but the future is 800v and beyond. Twice the voltage means significantly faster charging times for EVs. The Audi e-tron GT and Porsche Taycan, Lucid Air, Hyundai IONIQ 5 + 6, and Kia EV6 already use 800v architecture and they are capable of gaining about 200 miles of range in under 20 minutes. 800v battery systems can also be smaller than 400v systems. We believe that more auto manufacturers will make the move to 800v architectures in 2023 and beyond. Toyota/Lexus is already working on 800v systems and much of the industry is expected to shift to 800v systems by 2025 . These faster-charging EVs can take full advantage of ultrafast 350kW+ chargers currently on the market or in development. Tritium is currently planning to release a 400kW charger in the near future to meet the needs of ultrafast charging EVs. DC Wall Box Chargers But not every EV needs to charge at blistering speeds. Many commercial and fleet EVs can charge up over an hour-long lunch break or slowly overnight. That means commercial EV fleet owners can be better served by multiple, smaller DC fast chargers. DC wall box chargers offer high-speed charging in a compact, affordable, and scalable package. Tritium is currently developing a DC fast charging wall box for our PKM system. These compact chargers will connect to our PKM power rectification units and provide DC fast charging at scale for commercial fleet EVs. We expect the market for wall box DC fast chargers to grow in pace with the growth of commercial fleet EVs. Slower Public AC Charging Growth in 2023 Alternating current (AC) chargers were cheap and convenient in the early days of EV infrastructure. But they’re slow, capable of delivering a maximum power of just 22kW. Many public AC charging points are being replaced with DC chargers to improve turnaround. Even lower-power DC fast chargers (50kW) can charge EVs in half the time of the best AC chargers. DC chargers are becoming the standard for public charging. According to the IEA, the rate of DC charger adoption has grown faster than the rate for AC charger installations between 2015 and 2021 . In 2020, Europe installed far more DC fast chargers than AC chargers and in 2021 the number of fast charger installations were up 30% to about 50k units. The United States also saw rapid growth in DC fast charger installations during the same time. More than 15k DC fast chargers were installed in Korea in 2021, 50% more than 2020. Tritium expects to see continued growth in DC fast charging, and slowing growth for AC charging. We still see a role for AC charging at home where one or two cars can charge overnight, but many public AC chargers simply won’t be feasible for many charge point operators or businesses.

Courtesy of General Motors Listen to the article 6 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback . After years of turbulent supply chains and a rush to invest in electric vehicle manufacturing, automakers are scaling back production plans in the face of slowing EV demand. They’re also continuing their push to move supply chains away from China in a bid to comply with stricter Inflation Reduction Act tax credit requirements . Read on for the top manufacturing and supply chain trends set to shape the auto industry in 2024. U.S. automakers are scaling back their EV plans General Motors, Ford and others are putting the brakes on some of their EV production plans as consumer adoption lags behind expectations. Ford, for example, announced in September it was pausing construction of its $3.5 billion EV factory in Marshall, Michigan , after sluggish sales of its F-150 Lightning and other EVs prompted it to roll back its $50 billion production expansion plans. “Ford electrified their F150 because it was one of the best selling pickup trucks in the country, maybe in the world,” Adam Ragozzino, Principal Analyst, Batteries & e-Powertrains, Wards Intelligence, said in an interview. “But an electric pickup isn't really what mainstream pickup truck owners wanted. You know the guys that are working out of their truck towing, hauling tools, whatever it is, that doesn't fit the bill for them.” GM has made similar moves, announcing in October that it was abandoning plans to produce up to 400,000 EVs through mid-2024 as the company tries to balance market demand and profitability. Compounding the rival automakers' problems is the growing number of competitors vying for U.S. EV market share. “The legacy OEMs really need to take an ordinate amount of market share to maintain their current market share,” Ragozzino said. “ My prediction is if they don't get a mainstream [EV] on the market soon, they're going to find themselves with a lot less market share overall than they've ever had.” Slow EV sales prompted Ford to curb F-150 Lightning production. Courtesy of Ford Motor Co. Automakers will continue with nearshoring and reshoring efforts Automakers and suppliers are likely to continue to reshore and nearshore their operations, especially in Mexico, to reduce their financial risks by shortening their supply chains, said Dan Hearsch, partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners. Such strategies often lower freight costs, which have increased in recent years as freight prices have become more volatile, Hearsch said. They can also help companies abide by made-in-America and related provisions in federal policies and programs, such as the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act. Yet it can be challenging to establish supply bases in Mexico, as many of the largest suppliers already have as much business as they can support, Hearsch said. “It feels a little bit like China in the ’80s and ’90s, where if you weren't there relatively early you had to go invest time to develop relationships just to get companies to answer your RFP,” Hearsch said. “We're seeing companies go from just trying to source in Mexico to setting up their own operations.” Adding to these challenges is the competitive labor market. “You've got to deal with the fact that there's only so much labor, and there's so much demand for companies trying to get a piece of that manufacturing pie,” Hearsch said. BMW Group invested 500 million euros in its San Luis Potosí, Mexico, plant to produce EV batteries locally. Retrieved from BMW Group on January 09, 2024 EV battery recycling will grow as automakers try to cut costs and meet sustainability goals As more automakers look to decrease their reliance on China-based suppliers for raw materials such as cobalt, nickel and graphite, automakers are looking for new ways to fulfill their critical mineral needs for battery production. One solution is battery recycling initiatives in the U.S. In August, battery recycler Redwood Materials announced it raised over $1 billion in a Series D funding round. The funds will be used to expand the company’s U.S. battery supply chain, allowing customers to buy recycled battery materials domestically for the first time. Redwood Materials says its technology can recover roughly 95% of nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper from end-of-life EV batteries, which can reduce the costs of producing new ones. “I think it's going to be a massive industry,” said Steve Patton, Americas Mobility Sector Leader at EY. “And if you think about the cost and the scarcity of the minerals that we need to get, we have to go do this.” Redwood employees inspect battery materials for recycling. Courtesy of Redwood Materials Redwood aims to produce 100 GWh of cathode and anode components per year by 2025, which is enough to manufacture battery cells for around 1 million EVs annually. The company is targeting 500 GWh a year by 2030, which is enough for five million EVs. Patton noted that automakers may want to retain the rights to these critical raw materials once they are sourced for battery production or even at the time of mining. “They're trying to create almost closed cycle loops around who owns the minerals once they enter their ecosystem,” Patton said. “And so that is going to be an interesting challenge, too, who has the rights to these recycled minerals.” Disclosure: Informa is the owner of Automotive Dive's publisher, Industry Dive, and Wards Intelligence.
