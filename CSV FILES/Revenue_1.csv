Zeeba will add Canoo Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV) to its long-term fleet leasing portfolio. “We have a large committed, growing order book, are finalizing our multi-year allocations for 2023 customer deliveries and will share our manufacturing plan with the broader market shortly,” said Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO at Canoo. “This order is another milestone validating our product and strategy. Small & medium sized business (SMB) are the backbone of our communities, employing about half of all working Americans¹ and they are Zeeba's target customers. We put technology first and combined class leading ergonomics, a small vehicle footprint-to-cargo ratio and platform versatility while achieving a lower carbon footprint and higher return on investment for the operator, all of which will help SMBs compete.” Canoo vehicles: Modular and engineered for industry leading ROI Canoo vehicles are American-made Class 1 commercial electric vehicles built on the company’s proprietary multi-purpose platform (MPP) architecture that integrates all critical components. Most of service, maintenance and updates will be done over the air, which decreases vehicle downtime. Designed and engineered with the driver in mind, Canoo vehicles feature a panoramic front window to improve road visibility and utilize true steer by wire technology, resulting in more usable interior space and better driver ergonomics. Feedback from our recent real-world deliveries confirmed the superior user experience, based on ride, in-cabin comfort, road visibility and maneuverability, as well as unprecedented user ergonomics. The LDV combines 120 cubic feet of cargo volume with an 80kw battery pack with the handling and turning radius of a small passenger vehicle, making it a safer and more familiar experience for drivers. The LV is a people and goods mover with passenger seating configuration and the same battery pack, visibility and handling characteristics as the LDV due to its common platform. Tech Enabled and Flexible Fleet Solutions for Small & Medium Business Zeeba provides flexible and affordable fleet solutions so SMBs can focus on their products and customers and not worry about mobility. The Canoo LDV and LV modular design enables Zeeba to provide client-specific configurations that can be upfit to different use cases over the vehicle lifecycle. “We are thrilled to be able to deliver Canoo vehicles to our customers in the near future. We are focused on offering the most advanced fleet solutions and have recognized Canoo’s vehicles as leaders in technology driven sustainable mobility. We also wanted to secure EV vehicle supply for years to come,” said Kayvon Marashi, Chief Executive Officer for Zeeba Automotive Group, Inc. Zeeba provides a tailored approach to customers to help them efficiently and effectively operate their business and plans to achieve a minimum 50% electrification by Q1 of 2024. “The LDV & LV are going to be a game changer for businesses we serve. Canoo technology will allow our SMB customers to effectively and efficiently operate their businesses while reducing their carbon footprint. Zeeba has very ambitious electrification goals and we want to achieve leadership in fleet technology,” said Mike Paletz, Chief Strategy Officer at Zeeba. Zeeba will deploy Canoo LDVs & LVs to their SMB customers who look for customizable options when configuring their fleet, meeting their sustainability goals and benefitting from competitive operating cost.  The LDV & LV will be used by customers in the last mile delivery space, mobile goods, ride hailing, food delivery, trade professions and more.

Canoo return on investment,https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/mpdv,Canoo Unveils Fully-Electric Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle to Offer ...,"Canoo Unveils Fully-Electric Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle to Offer Best-in-Class Total Cost of Ownership | Press | Canoo | Electric Vehicles Universal Filter Code Home Press Videos Images Back to Canoo.com Home Press Videos Images Back to Canoo.com Canoo Unveils Fully-Electric Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle to Offer Best-in-Class Total Cost of Ownership Canoo’s vehicle is purposefully designed to offer maximum productivity, efficiency, class-leading cargo volume and cost savings Los Angeles, CA – (December 17, 2020) – Canoo , a company developing breakthrough electric vehicles (EVs), revealed today its all-electric multi-purpose delivery vehicle to be priced starting at approximately $33,000. [i] The vehicle is purposefully designed to maximize return on investment for its customers. It is based on Canoo’s proprietary electric platform and will be offered in two initial size variants, with others to follow. Limited availability will begin in 2022, with scaled production and launch planned for 2023. With its multi-purpose delivery vehicle, Canoo plans to offer customers best-in-class total cost of ownership, class-leading cargo volume, and functionally-designed features. [ii] Customers can pre-order the multi-purpose delivery vehicle for a refundable deposit of $100 per vehicle at www.canoo.com/mpdv . “We created our multi-purpose delivery vehicle from the inside out, with the ergonomics of the driver in mind and with attention to detail to help them be happier and more productive at work,” said Tony Aquila, Executive Chairman, Canoo. “The vehicle is affordable and offers greater cargo capacity than the current electric delivery offerings in its class. We aim to lower the total cost of ownership and increase return on investment for everyone from local small business owners to large fleets.” Multi-Purpose for Multiple Use Cases As an integral part of Canoo’s business strategy, the functional design of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle is meant to service a wide range of customers. It was built specifically with the needs of small businesses and large last-mile delivery companies in mind. The design of the model paired with the best-in-class total cost of ownership (TCO) also makes it a great option for independent contractors, utilities, service technicians and many more. Large customers, such as last-mile and package delivery fleets, retailers, major corporations and logistics companies, also have the option to co-develop a custom vehicle with Canoo to meet their specific requirements. Best-in-Class Total Cost of Ownership & Cargo Volume With this vehicle, Canoo plans to achieve best-in-class total cost of ownership through range and space efficiency, as well as durability and low maintenance costs. Leveraging the company’s proprietary platform is expected to reduce material and service costs, passing on considerable savings to customers. Canoo’s proprietary electric vehicle platform is the flattest in the industry and has enabled potentially class-leading interior cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Interior volume is also maximized through Canoo’s signature driver-forward architecture, which was designed with safety in mind. Canoo estimates that its multi-purpose delivery vehicle customers can achieve between $50,000 to $80,000 improvement on return on capital over six to seven years, depending on the use case, as compared to other top selling delivery vehicles. Productivity is our Passion To maximize user functionality, the production vehicle plans to offer a bi-directional onboard charger in lieu of adding a separate DC-AC converter, which will transform the vehicle into a power plant for equipment and tools. A 125V or 240V AC output power plug can be incorporated into the vehicle so tools such as saws, drills and air compressors can be conveniently powered up at remote destinations. The vehicle also enables various workstations. For example, drivers who have to take notes per delivery or job will have the ability to place a laptop or other devices to the left of the driver's seat. The vehicle was designed from the inside out to be sensitive to the ergonomics and productivity of the people using it. Additional vehicle customization examples that focus on ergonomics and productivity gains include high roof height, storage lockers, roll-up style door, ramp slide outs and more. [iii] Both vehicle variants are designed to offer a low step in height of 17 inches, allowing easy and comfortable access to the vehicle. With the space efficiency afforded by Canoo’s multi-purpose delivery vehicle, fleets can accommodate higher storage capacities to meet the increasing demands of their customers. The vehicle enables greater “up time,” or the actual hours of use, through a range of unique benefits, including: ● Greater cargo space with nearly 30% more parcel volume than other leading delivery vehicles in comparable segments. ● Range efficiency means more stops can be made on a single charge, helping to lower operating costs. ● Energy efficiency provides considerable savings in terms of operating expenses because the vehicle can go further per kilowatt of energy than the competition. ● Urban maneuverability enabled by Canoo’s steer-by-wire technology which eliminates hand-over-hand driving and increases range of motion and route options. Anticipated Vehicle Specifications [iv] The multi-purpose delivery vehicle is a ground up electric design, meaning it was not retrofitted or designed based off of a gas- or diesel-powered model. This has enabled a more thoughtful, reliable and efficient EV design made specifically for people to use the vehicle as a workspace, such as plugging in their tools for a remote job. The multi-purpose delivery vehicle will be built on Canoo’s proprietary EV platform which features a steel frame construction, transverse composite leaf springs, a double wishbone suspension system, variable ratio steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire. The vehicle will be fully connected with data reporting capabilities and will feature Level 2.5 autonomy and over-the-air software updates. The vehicle will also support cutting-edge software-as-a-service (SaaS) to help fleets improve their total cost of professional ownership (TCPO) by allowing them to manage their assets, route plan, run diagnostics and support drivers with safety, awareness and ergonomic information. Canoo’s industry leading steer-by-wire system will enable a smooth transition into self-driving capabilities once full autonomy becomes commercially available. Steer-by-wire also helps accelerate the internationalization plans for the vehicle, allowing for rapid deployment of a right-hand drive offering. The two vehicle variants, multi-purpose delivery vehicle 1 (MPDV1) and multi-purpose delivery vehicle 2 (MPDV2), are expected to offer three battery sizes—80, 60 and 40 kilowatt-hours (kWh)—with the 80-kWh size featuring a DC Fast Charging time of 28 minutes from 20% to 80% charge. MPDV1 Offering more capacity at an affordable price, the MPDV1’s superior range efficiency and urban mobility is enabled by a space efficient footprint. The vehicle is also designed to fit within many height restricted areas like parking garages.

The Electric Revolution As companies are increasingly pressured by both regulators and consumers to reduce their carbon footprint, the adoption of EVs among commercial delivery vehicles is expected to see a dramatic increase. This shift is projected to be led by the light commercial vehicle segment, an initial target segment for Canoo. The demand for EV light commercial vehicles in the United States, Europe and China is expected to grow at a 33% CAGR from 2019 to 2028, according to BloombergNEF. Further, the growth and increase in efficiency of e-commerce has resulted in a change in consumer expectations with e-commerce providers increasingly pushing to reduce package delivery times from two days to the same day. According to Canoo commissioned research, it is projected that same day parcel delivery volumes in the United States will grow to 10 billion parcels by 2030, reflecting an approximate 23% annual growth rate since 2019. This change is expected to result in an increase in demand for smaller delivery vehicles that can efficiently execute smaller volume and more frequent delivery routes. The vehicle is built off of Canoo’s platform, which has enabled the accelerated design and launch timelines of the company’s second vehicle model. Other variations of the multi-purpose delivery vehicle will follow, and Canoo plans to announce a service network at a later date. While a number of EV companies have recently announced plans to produce delivery vehicles, the last-mile delivery market is an entirely distinct segment and classification of vehicle differentiated from larger and midsize delivery vehicles and trucks. Last-mile delivery vehicles operate in predominantly urban environments with diverse use cases, thus requiring a compact size and maneuverability. The vehicles used are generally from the light commercial vehicles segment and a majority of the vehicles are from the class 1 category. These class 1 vehicles carry the same stringent regulatory and crash testing requirements that passenger cars are subjected to. Canoo’s platform, which is specifically designed for class 1 vehicles, has been validated to support these crash requirements via its passenger vehicle program. This provides Canoo a significant competitive advantage as most of the players in the commercial vehicle space have not crash tested their platforms given their focus on larger sized vehicles. Following its U.S. commercial debut, Canoo will look to launch the multi-purpose delivery vehicle in other markets such as Canada, Mexico and Europe.

Jul 27, 2023 at 2:19PM Key Points Chinese authorities look like they will be providing Nio and other EV makers helpful tailwinds. A surprise investment and partnership in the sector pushed Chinese EV stocks higher. Investors are anticipating initial sales, as QuantumScape is one step closer to commercialization. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: NIO Nio Market Cap $10B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.82%) $0.05 Current Price $6.14 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More The direction of EV stocks this week was a story of the haves and have-nots. What happened It's been a week of big gains so far for some electric vehicle (EV) stocks. The stocks of battery manufacturer QuantumScape ( QS -3.05% ) and Chinese EV maker Nio ( NIO 0.82% ) have been soaring. As of Thursday afternoon, QuantumScape and Nio shares were higher for the week by about 19% and 29%, respectively, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . There were some laggards in the sector as well, though. EV start-up Canoo 's ( GOEV -3.16% ) stock was lower by 14% at that point. So what Investors were rewarding some progress reported by QuantumScape this week. They also have renewed high hopes for Nio, with expectations of economic tailwinds, along with news of a surprise partnership between a Chinese EV peer and another global automaker. Nio shares moved consistently higher throughout the week, thanks to general macroeconomic news rather than anything specific announced by the company. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global GDP outlook and now sees global economic growth of 3% both this year and in 2024. That's higher than what the institution projected this past spring. While risks remain -- some particularly specific to China -- that's still good news for Nio as it expands its EV sales in Europe. The Chinese government is also attempting to head off a slowdown in growth. Concerns surrounding its economic recovery prompted officials there to acknowledge the need for added support that includes moves aimed at boosting investments and consumer spending. One new investment that likely made authorities happy was one between Nio's Chinese competitor XPeng and German automaker Volkswagen that was announced on Wednesday. Volkswagen is hoping to fast-track its entry into China's EV market, and the partnership brought instant added credibility to XPeng and its technology. Two new EVs will be jointly developed using XPeng's G9 SUV platform, with production scheduled to begin in 2026. And its connectivity and advanced driver-assistance system software will be used for the vehicles that will be sold under the Volkswagen brand in China. In return, Volkswagen will invest $700 million in XPeng with a 5% minority stake. That news likely had investors wondering if there could be a similar deal involving Nio in the future, helping to push shares even higher. For its part, QuantumScape updated investors with its second-quarter results, and it generated some excitement as the company inches closer to commercializing its solid-state battery technology. That technology holds promise, as it could provide a faster-charging, safer, and longer-lasting EV battery. That could be just the thing to evaporate range anxiety among many consumers on the fence about shifting to battery electric vehicles. Investors focused on one bit of news in QuantumScape's latest update. The company stated: ""We are already working closely with a prospective launch customer in the automotive sector for this [commercial-level] cell, with the goal of bringing our next-generation technology to the electric vehicle market as rapidly as possible."" Now what That type of progress is what investors speculating in still-unprofitable EV companies want to see. And that's something Canoo has yet to provide on any meaningful level. While the company has a production facility and several orders lined up for its specialty EV offerings, it hasn't yet begun production. And with cash and cash equivalents of just $6.7 million as of March 31, the company has had to focus on its financial position. That helps explain the discrepancy among EV sector stock returns this week. While start-ups are always risky and speculative, investors seem to be moving money to the companies that look to be making meaningful progress in the right direction.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Better EV Stock: Lucid Group vs. Canoo By Leo Sun –
Jun 28, 2023 at 9:44AM Key Points Lucid and Canoo both overpromised and underdelivered. Lucid is actually producing vehicles and has enough cash for another year. Canoo hasn't produced any vehicles yet, and it could run out of cash soon. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: LCID Lucid Group Market Cap $8B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.20%) $0.08 Current Price $3.71 Price as of February 16, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More Which of these burnt-out EV stocks has a better shot at getting recharged? Lucid Group ( LCID 2.20% ) and Canoo ( GOEV -3.16% ) are both electric vehicle (EV) makers that went public by merging with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Both companies also set lofty goals during their SPAC presentations, but subsequently disappointed their investors by broadly missing those targets. Lucid, which went public in July 2021, initially told investors it could produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 49,000 vehicles in 2023. But it only produced 7,180 vehicles in 2022, and now plans to produce ""over 10,000"" vehicles in 2023. Canoo, which closed its merger in December 2020, predicted it would generate $329 million in revenue in 2022 by selling 10,000 vehicles. However, it actually generated $0 in revenue during the year, and didn't ship a single vehicle. Image source: Lucid. Those broken promises broke both stocks. Over the past 12 months, Lucid's stock plunged more than 70%. Canoo's stock sank 80%, and could be delisted if it remains below the $1 threshold. Should contrarian investors buy either of these out-of-favor EV stocks as a turnaround play for a new bull market? The differences and similarities between Lucid and Canoo Lucid's only vehicle so far is the Air sedan, a high-end EV that starts at $89,000 and boasts a longer range than Tesla 's Model S. It plans to launch its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV, in early 2024. Canoo is currently developing three types of EVs: a lifestyle delivery vehicle (LDV) for mainstream consumers and businesses, a multipurpose delivery vehicle (MPDV) for logistics services, and an electric pickup truck. It hasn't mass produced any of those vehicles yet, but Walmart agreed to buy 4,500 of its LDVs last July. Both of these companies have attracted the attention of Saudi Arabian investors. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) already owns more than 60% of Lucid, and the Saudi Arabian government plans to buy 100,000 vehicles from Lucid over the following decade. Lucid believes that with the Saudi Arabian government's firm support, it can expand its annual capacity from 34,000 vehicles today to 500,000 vehicles in 2025. This January, Canoo signed a deal with GCC Olayan, a subsidiary of the Olayan Saudi Holding Company (OSHCO), to distribute, sell, and service its EVs in Saudi Arabia. It opened up its first preorders for its LDVs and pickups in Saudi Arabia in April. Canoo believes it can finally start to mass produce its vehicles by the end of 2023 and expand its annual capacity to 20,000 vehicles, but investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt. Which company is in better financial shape? In 2022, Lucid generated $608 million in revenue but racked up a net loss of $2.56 billion. For 2023, analysts expect its revenue to rise 56% to $948 million as its net loss widens to $2.79 billion. Lucid ended the first quarter of 2023 with $4.1 billion in total liquidity, which it claims will last through ""at least"" the second quarter of 2024. Its debt-to-equity ratio of 1 also gives it some breathing room to raise more funds. Canoo posted a net loss of $488 million in 2022, and analysts only expect a slightly narrower loss of $369 million in 2023. They also expect it to finally generate $129 million in revenue as it starts to mass produce and deliver its vehicles this year. But if Canoo doesn't ramp up its production soon, it could be in serious trouble , because it ended the first quarter of 2023 with only $6.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Its debt-to-equity ratio of 1.1 suggests it could still raise some more cash as its coffers run dry, but it could struggle to gain fresh funds at reasonable rates in this tough market. Lucid currently trades at 13 times this year's sales, while Canoo seems a lot cheaper at 2 times this year's sales. However, Canoo arguably deserves to trade at a much lower valuation because it isn't actually selling any vehicles yet. The obvious winner: Lucid Lucid and Canoo are both risky stocks, but the former is a better buy than the latter for three simple reasons: It's actually mass producing its vehicles, it has a lot of support from the Saudi Arabian government, and it has enough cash for at least another year. Canoo might eventually mount a comeback, but I wouldn't put too much faith in its long-term recovery until I actually see its first vehicles roll off the production line.

USA . Stock . Canoo Inc Summary Performance Analysis Advice Profile Financials Valuation Risk Sentiment Insiders Prediction Options Leverage Analysis GOEV Stock USD 0.14 0.01 6.67% Canoo Inc secures Sharpe Ratio (or Efficiency) of -0.19, which signifies that the company had -0.19% return per unit of risk over the last 3 months. Our standpoint towards foreseeing the risk of any stock is to look at both systematic and unsystematic factors of the business, including all available market data and technical indicators . Canoo Inc exposes twenty-three different technical indicators , which can help you to evaluate volatility embedded in its stock price that cannot be diversified away . Please confirm Canoo's Mean Deviation of 5.38, standard deviation of 7.18, and Risk Adjusted Performance of (0.05) to double-check the risk estimate we provide. Key indicators related to Canoo's volatility include: 30 Days Market Risk Out of control Chance Of Distress Very High 30 Days Economic Sensitivity Follows the market closely Canoo Stock volatility depicts how high the prices fluctuate around the mean (or its average) price. In other words, it is a statistical measure of the distribution of Canoo daily returns, and it is calculated using variance and standard deviation. We also use Canoo's beta, its sensitivity to the market , as well as its odds of financial distress to provide a more practical estimation of Canoo volatility. Canoo Since volatility provides investors with entry points to take advantage of stock prices , companies, such as Canoo can benefit from it. Downward market volatility can be a perfect environment for investors who play the long game. Here, they may decide to buy additional stocks of Canoo at lower prices. For example, an investor can purchase Canoo stock that has halved in price over a short period. This will lower your average cost per share, thereby improving your portfolio's performance when the markets normalize.

A stock that has erratic price changes quickly hits new highs, and lows are considered highly volatile. A stock with relatively stable price changes has low volatility. A highly volatile stock is riskier, but the risk cuts both ways. Investing in highly volatile security can either be highly successful, or you may experience significant failure. There are two main types of Canoo's volatility: Historical Volatility This type of stock volatility measures Canoo's fluctuations based on previous trends. It's commonly used to predict Canoo's future behavior based on its past. However, it cannot conclusively determine the future direction of the stock.

Canoo Projected Return Density Against Market Given the investment horizon of 90 days  the stock has the beta coefficient of 2.4754 . This usually indicates as the benchmark fluctuates upward, the company is expected to outperform it on average. However, if the benchmark returns are projected to be negative, Canoo will likely underperform. Most traded equities are subject to two types of risk - systematic (i.e., market) and unsystematic (i.e., nonmarket or company-specific) risk. Unsystematic risk is the risk that events specific to Canoo or Automobiles sector will adversely affect the stock's price. This type of risk can be diversified away by owning several different stocks in different industries whose stock prices have shown a small correlation to each other. On the other hand, systematic risk is the risk that Canoo's price will be affected by overall stock market movements and cannot be diversified away. So, no matter how many positions you have, you cannot eliminate market risk. However, you can measure a Canoo stock's historical response to market movements and buy it if you are comfortable with its volatility direction. Beta and standard deviation are two commonly used measures to help you make the right decision. The company has a negative alpha, implying that the risk taken by holding this instrument is not justified. Canoo Inc is significantly underperforming NYSE Composite. Predicted Return Density Returns Canoo's volatility is measured either by using standard deviation or beta. Standard deviation will reflect the average amount of how canoo stock's price will differ from the mean after some time.To get its calculation, you should first determine the mean price during the specified period then subtract that from each price point. What Drives a Canoo Price Volatility? Several factors can influence a stock's market volatility: Industry Specific events can influence volatility within a particular industry. For instance, a significant weather upheaval in a crucial oil-production site may cause oil prices to increase in the oil sector. The direct result will be the rise in the stock price of oil distribution companies. Similarly, any government regulation in a specific industry could negatively influence stock prices due to increased regulations on compliance that may impact the company's future earnings and growth. Political and Economic environment When governments make significant decisions regarding trade agreements, policies, and legislation regarding specific industries, they will influence stock prices. Everything from speeches to elections may influence investors, who can directly influence the stock prices in any particular industry. The prevailing economic situation also plays a significant role in stock prices. When the economy is doing well, investors will have a positive reaction and hence, better stock prices and vice versa. The Company's Performance Sometimes volatility will only affect an individual company. For example, a revolutionary product launch or strong earnings report may attract many investors to purchase the company. This positive attention will raise the company's stock price. In contrast, product recalls and data breaches may negatively influence a company's stock prices. Canoo Stock Risk Measures Most traded equities are subject to two types of risk - systematic (i.e., market) and unsystematic (i.e., nonmarket or company-specific) risk.

This type of risk can be diversified away by owning several different stocks in different industries whose stock prices have shown a small correlation to each other.

So, no matter how many positions you have, you cannot eliminate market risk. However, you can measure a Canoo stock's historical response to market movements and buy it if you are comfortable with its volatility direction.

Canoo's systematic risk is the inherent uncertainty of the entire market, and therefore cannot be mitigated even by pair-trading it against the equity that is not highly correlated to it.

At a combined cost of $119,850, these three Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) are the first of their kind in the state fleet, with one each assigned to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Corrections. OKLAHOMA CITY, OK – Today, the State of Oklahoma received its first three made-in-Oklahoma electric vehicles from Canoo as an innovative part of the state’s ongoing fleet modernization initiative . At a combined cost of $119,850, these three Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDVs) are the first of their kind in the state fleet, with one each assigned to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Corrections. “For the first time in 17 years, vehicle manufacturing is back in Oklahoma,” said Oklahoma Gov. J. Kevin Stitt. “As we find new efficiencies within the fleet, Canoo’s new Oklahoma-made electric vehicles align perfectly with our fleet modernization goals, and I couldn’t be more excited to see them on the roads. I’m grateful for the team at OMES who are working hard to deliver taxpayers more for their money while finding ambitious new ways to improve our fleet.” Fleet modernization is one of the governor’s current top initiatives to realize efficiencies across the state. Following his executive order , OMES Fleet Management has worked closely with agencies to identify underutilized vehicles, downsize the state’s overall fleet and explore ways to advance central fleet operations. In 2023 alone, agencies have voluntarily turned in a total of 917 vehicles that have been auctioned through State Surplus, saving Oklahoma taxpayers an estimated $11.7 million. “I am proud of the savings and asset reductions we’ve made so far in our fleet effort,” said John Suter, state chief operating officer and OMES executive director. “This progress positions us well to reinvest that money into future-focused, cost-effective vehicle options that better align with our goals.” While pushing hard to reduce waste, executive leaders have also sought ways to modernize vehicles within the fleet to drive better value and long-term returns on investment. One of these modernizations includes replacing outdated vehicles that are costly to maintain with environmentally friendly electric vehicles made right here in Oklahoma. “Oklahoma is hub for the creation of new and innovative technologies, and Canoo is a global leader in electric vehicle development,” said Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell. “Beyond innovation, Canoo is creating over 1,300 jobs in Oklahoma, marking a significant economic impact for the state. I look forward to our continued partnership and am excited to welcome these new vehicles to the state.” The LDVs delivered to the State of Oklahoma are the first commercial motor vehicles built in-state since 2006 and the first to come out of Canoo’s new assembly facility in Oklahoma City. Paired with the company’s battery module manufacturing plant in Pryor, Oklahoma, Canoo is establishing roots in the “Sooner State,” opening the door for greater economic development and employment opportunities for Oklahomans. “Canoo is proud to bring motor vehicle manufacturing back to Oklahoma and create high-paying jobs,” said Tony Aquila, investor, chairman and CEO of Canoo. “Our innovative LDV 130 delivery vehicles will work for Oklahomans and help state agencies improve fleet efficiency. Our vehicles are perfect for how the state uses vehicles today, and our advanced telematics and lower overall cost of ownership will continue to pay dividends down the road.” As the three Canoo LDVs are integrated into the government fleet pool, state leaders will continue to evaluate how the vehicles can best support agency missions and citizen services going forward.
