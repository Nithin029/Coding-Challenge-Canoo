Bartlett Infographics by Andy Bergmann July 7, 2022 Photo: Ford A growing number of consumers are eager to buy a battery electric vehicle , especially if certain concerns related to EV ownership are addressed, such as creating greater access to charging, extending vehicle range, and lowering purchase prices, according to findings from the largest-ever nationally representative survey from Consumer Reports (PDF). The survey of 8,027 U.S. adults found differences across racial/ethnic and income groups in terms of how people perceive EVs and the potential purchase barriers. Almost half of respondents also reported being unaware of existing federal and state incentives that would defray the purchase price of many EVs, sometimes up to $7,500 for the federal credit, key knowledge that might sway someone to make an EV purchase. With improvements to the nation’s charging networks, more lower-priced EVs coming to market, and increasing range from battery technology advances, many barriers to EV ownership are showing signs of breaking down over time. The survey results bear this out: We found that 14 percent of American drivers say they would “definitely” buy or lease an electric-only vehicle if they were to buy a vehicle today. That’s up markedly from the 4 percent who said the same in a 2020 nationally representative survey from CR of 3,392 licensed U.S. drivers. more on evs Hot, New Electric Cars That Are Coming Soon How to Decide If a Hybrid, Plug-In Hybrid, or Fully Electric Car Is Right for You How to Find All the Available Electric Car Incentives How the Tesla Model S Changed the World 10 Tips to Get the Most out of a Tank of Gas Overall, our latest survey found that more than a third of Americans would “definitely” or “seriously” consider buying or leasing an electric-only vehicle) if they were to buy a vehicle today. Among their reasons: More than 3 in 10 U.S. adults say that it costs less to charge an EV than to refuel a gas car (33 percent), overall lifetime costs are lower (31 percent), and maintenance costs are lower (28 percent). “The survey shows that there is clear interest among Americans in reducing costs for transportation and lowering their environmental impact,” says Quinta Warren, PhD, CR’s associate director of sustainability policy. “It underscores some key concerns, but fortunately, many of these barriers to owning a battery-electric vehicle EV can be addressed through experience and education.” There’s no denying soaring demand for electric vehicles and hybrids. Gas prices are at record highs, and Americans increasingly are turning to electric vehicles. EV sales rose 76 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, according to Cox Automotive, an information and services company. EVs promise reduced operating costs, and there are more choices on the market, with more models from various categories on the way . Consumer Reports conducted the survey to better understand demand and awareness of battery EVs and low-carbon fuels. It was partially funded by the environment-focused philanthropic group Breakthrough Energy and the Energy Foundation , a nonprofit organization dedicated to a safe, equitable economy powered by green energy. It was fielded Jan. 27 to Feb. 18, 2022, when the national average price for gasoline ranged from $3.34 to $3.52 per gallon. The price of gas has surged to a national average of about $5 per gallon for regular as of late June. (Download a PDF of the survey report .) The survey results illustrate an EV landscape in transition, as more Americans become aware of the purchase option in a societal atmosphere of increasing concern about climate change and the role fossil fuels are playing. CR is committed to supporting sustainable transportation, reducing harmful emissions, and saving drivers money—so much so that fuel economy is a key factor in the Overall Score that we give to every car we purchase and test. As a result, the Overall Scores elevate good all-around models that are energy-efficient, helping shoppers make their purchase decisions and encouraging automakers to prioritize energy efficiency. CR also launched a Green Choice designation last year using vehicle emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency, highlighting the vehicles that are among 20 percent lowest contributors to smog-forming and greenhouse gas emissions for their model year. You can find these Green Choice vehicles on our website and in our print publications. They are denoted by a green leaf icon wherever our ratings are presented. Check for applicable incentives and tax credits with CR’s Electric Vehicle Savings Finder . Highlights From the Survey EV visibility: Four in 10 Americans (44 percent) have seen a battery-electric vehicle in their neighborhood in the past month. EV experience: 17 percent of all Americans have been a passenger in an electric-only EV in the past 12 months, and only 7 percent have driven one. Only 2 percent of Americans currently own or lease a battery electric vehicle. Views on climate change: Seven in 10 Americans say the issue of climate change is personally “very important” (35 percent) or “somewhat important” (35 percent) to them. Three out of 4 Americans agree that human activities contribute to climate change. Erasing barriers: Charging logistics (61 percent) is the top barrier to getting an EV, followed by the number of miles the vehicle can go before needing a charge (55 percent) and the costs involved with buying and maintaining an EV (52 percent). EV incentives: Almost half of Americans (46 percent) have not heard about any incentives available for electric-only vehicle owners. Demographic viewpoints: Our survey found that some groups are more likely than others to buy or lease an EV as their next vehicle: • Males are more likely than females. • Younger adults are more likely than older adults. • Americans with a higher education are more likely than those with a lower education. • Americans with a higher household income are more likely than those with a lower household income. • Americans who live in urban areas are more likely than those living in suburban or rural settings. Low-carbon fuels: Overall, two-thirds of Americans (67 percent) say that given a choice, they would be likely to use low-carbon fuel in their personal vehicle if the cost per gallon were the same as the cost of traditional fuel. Experiences With EVs Affect Attitude and Desire Americans who have experience with EVs, including simply being a passenger in one, are more likely to be interested in purchasing one. Overall, only 7 percent of Americans have driven one in the past 12 months, whereas 20 percent of those who say they would definitely buy/lease an EV as their next vehicle, have driven one. This makes sense because EVs are relatively new and in some ways quite different from a traditional gasoline car. “Many EVs are enjoyable to drive, with quick, silent acceleration, and balanced handling, aided by their large, low-mounted battery,” says Gabe Shenhar, associate director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “In short, they are often quite a treat to drive.” EV Sticker Shock Of Americans who said cost-related factors were holding them back from getting an EV, almost 6 in 10 said purchase price was the biggest barrier. Of those, a larger percentage of white (60 percent) and English-speaking Asian Americans (66 percent) surveyed say “purchase price” is one of the cost considerations holding them back from getting an electric-only vehicle, compared with Hispanic (55 percent) and Black Americans (46 percent). The attitude toward purchase price may be influenced by the attention given to pricey models currently on the market from Audi, BMW, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Rivian, and Tesla. But mainstream automakers are introducing lower-priced models, including the Kia Niro , Subaru Solterra , and Toyota bZ4X . Some shoppers may be surprised to learn that prices for the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV, Hyundai Kona, and Nissan Leaf have dropped . The 2023 Chevy Bolt now starts at just $26,595—putting it around $20,000 less than the price of the average new car. And for many EVs, the true purchase price may be even less than the sticker price because of federal, state, and even power utility incentives. Almost half of Americans (46 percent) are unaware that there are incentives available. “ Tax rebates and other incentives can reduce the purchase price of EVs by thousands of dollars,” says Warren, CR’s associate director of sustainability policy. It can be tricky to determine which incentives are applicable to a given model because federal tax credit eligibility is based on overall sales volume. To make this easier, Consumer Reports’ Electric Vehicle Savings Finder highlights local and federal incentives and tax rebates, based on your ZIP code and the model you’re researching. This feature is part of our free membership at CR.org, requiring just an email address to access. Cost of Vehicle Ownership “Most EVs are less expensive to own than similar traditional cars,” according to Warren, “even when factoring a higher purchase price for a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle.” And yet, just over half of Americans (52 percent) who weren’t already committed to buying an EV said the costs of buying, owning, and maintaining it would prevent them from leasing or purchasing one. The views and concerns vary among different groups. Of those who say cost-related factors would prevent them from getting an EV, a larger percentage of Black (54 percent) and Hispanic (48 percent) Americans than white Americans (37 percent) say maintenance and repair costs are holding them back. However, a previous study by CR , conducted in 2020, revealed that EV owners spend around half as much on maintenance and repair over the vehicle’s typical lifetime as gas-only car owners do. EVs have fewer moving parts and fluids that need to be changed. Even the brakes tend to last longer. Plus, the cost of powering the car is also far lower, especially now with $5-per-gallon gas. Charging an EV About 6 in 10 Americans who weren’t already committed to purchasing an EV say concerns about where and when they would be able to charge it (61 percent) and how far that charge will take them (55 percent) have been holding them back from buying. In particular, concerns for charging logistics are greatest among white and English-speaking Asian Americans at 67 percent for each group. The good news: There are now more than 48,000 U.S. public charging locations, often with multiple charging connections, and many more on the way. Fifty percent of Americans say free public charging stations are the charging option that would most likely encourage them to buy or lease an electric-only vehicle, followed by 47 percent who say it is the ability to charge where they live, and 45 percent who say easy access to fast-charging public stations. Only 10 percent considered workplace charging to be the most important option. For those who can charge at home, CR has found good wall-mounted charging units for $500 to $700. Installing one costs from $492 to $1,191, according to HomeAdvisor. EV range is commonly around 250 miles (far more than most people typically drive each day), meaning that overnight charging can satisfy most drivers’ common needs. Experienced EV owners consider range to be much less of an issue than non-owners, supporting this assertion. Hybrid Savings For those not ready to commit to a full-on EV, hybrids can be a smart alternative and save owners a lot on gas. A hybrid combines a gasoline engine with an electric assist, allowing the powertrain to optimize its operation for maximum fuel economy. With a regular hybrid, the engine and brakes generate electricity, so you never need to plug in the car. As an example, trading in a 2017 Chevrolet Equinox V6 for a 2022 Toyota RAV4 hybrid (another small SUV) could save $1,775 a year in fuel costs, based on our tests and gas at $5 per gallon. That’s almost $9,000 in fuel savings over five years. Moving to a pricier Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid would yield even greater savings, while providing a balance between 42 miles of local electric-only driving and the long-distance range and convenience that gasoline provides. (For the RAV4 Prime, the total range per tank and one charge is 540 miles.) The Promise of Low-Carbon Fuels Running vehicles on electricity is just one way to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions in transportation. Another is a shift to low-carbon fuels derived from clean, often renewable sources. Some low-carbon fuels are designed to work in regular gasoline-powered vehicles, and others may require new powertrain technology. The term “low-carbon fuels” refers to a range of solutions, but it is most often associated with ethanol and biodiesel developed from plants. It also encompasses other energy sources such as hydrogen, liquified natural gas, and propane. The survey focused on “drop-in fuels” that could be used in current vehicles without modification. The results show that Americans are quite receptive to the possibility of using these in their own personal vehicles, and they see the value in their use for other applications, such as aviation. Two-thirds of Americans said they would be likely to use low-carbon fuel instead of traditional gasoline in their personal vehicle if the cost per gallon was the same as the cost for traditional fuel. Those who are more likely to purchase an electric-only vehicle are also much more likely to say that they’d use low-carbon fuels in their personal vehicles and if they had the choice would choose a flight on a plane that uses low-carbon fuel. The survey showed that there is the willingness to shift to another fuel type for its environmental benefit, however, it is important that the cars be designed to use it. Today’s regular gas typically is 10 to 15 percent bio-ethanol, a plant-derived fuel. Higher concentrations require a flex-fuel engine designed to handle the different chemistry, including a special fuel pump and fuel injection system. “When it comes to reducing fuels’ carbon emission, there are several things we can do,” says Mohammad Tayarani, PhD, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports. “As automakers roll out more electric vehicles, there are other low-carbon fuels that could complement the transition to EVs. Plus, there is huge potential for low-carbon fuels to power planes, boats, and other transportation for both freight and people."" @consumerreports Here are 5 simple ways to get more range out of your #electricvehicle .

Consumer opinion towards EV,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-vehicle-buyers-demand-new-experiences,Electric-vehicle (EV) buyers demand new experiences | McKinsey,"Electric-vehicle (EV) buyers demand new experiences | McKinsey Skip to main content Electric-vehicle buyers demand new experiences July 28, 2023 | Article Thomas Furcher Isabela Hidalgo Giraldo Felix Rupalla Anna-Sophie Smith Consumer attitudes toward electric vehicles are changing fast—and so are expectations of the car-purchasing experience. (6 pages) When buying an electric vehicle, consumers want an experience that matches their expectations of the car itself. That is, something exciting and innovative but also reliable and predictable. They expect to both transact online and negotiate with a real person, and they still need to take a test drive. However, the overall experience needs to be more seamless, more personalized, and more flexible than it was in the days of forecourt walkarounds. About the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility These insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility—from consumer needs to modal mix across urban and rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal. These are some of the findings of McKinsey’s latest Future of Auto Retail consumer survey, 1 Future of Auto Retail consumer survey, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility consumer insights, August 2022, global n = 4,078. Consumers were interviewed in China, Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States. which polled more than 4,000 respondents globally, focusing on consumer sentiment around electrification, the car-purchasing experience, and innovations in automotive retail. The findings show that consumers expect an excellent experience but are not always sure that the industry is ready to meet their needs. In this article, we show how growth in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) is shaping the automotive retail journey. While consumers enjoy digital interactions, they are concerned about factors including opaque pricing, complexity in the configuration process, and variability between dealer offerings. When it comes to test drives, consumers are increasingly interested in new formats, including testing virtually or at home. What do these shifts mean for the automotive retail industry? First, that companies must embrace bold decisions and innovation to meet the needs of digital consumers. Also, as attitudes evolve, that new entrants will shake up the market. The key for all market participants will be to keep a close eye on trends and be ready to respond with features that excite consumers and support long-term demand. Intent is accelerating More consumers than ever are considering buying an EV (Exhibit 1). According to the McKinsey Mobility Consumer Pulse Survey, the proportion of consumers considering battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) rose by five percentage points to 20 percent between December 2021 and December 2022, while the proportion considering a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) rose by four percentage points to 22 percent. 2 McKinsey Mobility Consumer Pulse Survey, December 2021–22. Interviews took place in 13 countries. The survey also shows a four-percentage-point drop in EV skepticism by consumers, from 23 percent of consumers who categorically do not want to switch to EVs, to 19 percent. 1 Increasing comfort with online buying In a world dominated by digital engagement, consumers’ first instinct when considering a car purchase is to go online. One in three buyers say they will not only research but also buy online for their next car purchase, citing simplicity and speed as key drivers. In China, more than half of respondents say that they would buy a vehicle online, regardless of power train choice. In other geographies, online purchasing is more favored among EV buyers, with twice as many choosing online over physical transactions. In a world dominated by digital engagement, consumers’ first instinct when considering a car purchase is to go online. Despite enthusiasm for digital, traditional approaches remain popular. Forty-four percent of consumers say that they value a personal connection, and 40 percent say that they appreciate the opportunity for price negotiation. Indeed, only 24 percent say they want an entirely human-free experience. Brand loyalty put to the test In times of systemic change, consumers are more willing to abandon long-standing loyalties. This presents a test for established brands (Exhibit 2). More than 50 percent of respondents say they may try a new brand when they switch to electric . And if only BEVs are considered, the proportion rises to 70 percent. 2 Consumers are not wowed by the purchasing experience Of consumers who bought a car in the past three years, only 53 percent say they were very satisfied with the experience. Top pain points included price transparency, vehicle availability, and process complexity (Exhibit 3). In addition, as supply chains catch up in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of availability for test drives and long delivery wait times are high on consumers’ minds. 3 Of consumers who bought a car in the past three years, only 53 percent say they were very satisfied with the experience. Top pain points included price transparency, vehicle availability, and process complexity. Some pain points are more acute in the EV space. Thirty-three percent of consumers say that they regret a lack of options for personalized configurations, compared with only 25 percent of traditional car buyers. Meanwhile, 33 percent demand a smaller set of preconfigured options, and 28 percent want the opportunity to change configuration postpurchase and predelivery, compared with only 20 percent of traditional car buyers on both counts. When asked about potential adaptations and innovations in the purchasing process, respondents’ top preferences include simplicity, convenience, higher levels of personalization, and greater price transparency—all core features of the digital experience. Future EV buyers place more emphasis than traditional buyers on simplicity and personalization in the vehicle-selection process (Exhibit 4). 4 Test drives are a key battleground Few people want to buy a car without test driving it first. Indeed, across both the combustion engine and EV categories, 87 percent of consumers say they want to test drive before purchasing, and the proportion holds steady across demographics and geographies. Given the different experience offered by electric vehicles and consumers’ common lack of knowledge of EVs, test drives are even more important in that segment. Reasons include getting a feel for performance and handling (61 percent) and comparing the electric car with their current one (45 percent). EV buyers also want to learn about charging. Few people want to buy a car without test driving it first. Indeed, across both the combustion engine and EV categories, 87 percent of consumers say they want to test drive before purchasing. Consumers are open to new test drive formats, including at-home test drives, rentals, and even virtual-driving experiences, cited by 53 percent of Chinese respondents as a possibility (Exhibit 5). Many consumers are willing to pay for a home test drive. Globally, 80 percent of consumers say that they would pay at least $25, and more than half would pay up to $100 for the experience. 5 Market participants must plan for disruption The trends shaping the automotive retail landscape are powerful and impact almost every aspect of the customer journey. In addition, the evolving landscape brings complexity , with consumers demanding more innovation and convenience but also remaining attached to aspects of the traditional experience. There is a sense of fluidity in attitudes that opens the market to increased competition. As demand for EVs continues to rise, we expect these trends to deepen and accelerate. To optimize their performance, both incumbents and new entrants need to think carefully, seek out pockets of value, and be flexible in meeting changing consumer needs.

(Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images) About four-in-ten Americans (38%) say they’re very or somewhat likely to seriously consider an electric vehicle (EV) for their next vehicle purchase, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans’ views on electric vehicles. We surveyed 10,329 U.S. adults from May 30 to June 4, 2023. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology . Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology . Half of U.S. adults say they are not too or not at all likely to consider purchasing an EV, while another 13% say they do not plan to purchase a vehicle. The share of the public interested in purchasing an EV is down 4 percentage points from May 2022. Over the past year, the Biden administration has announced a range of measures aimed at increasing EV adoption, including tax credits for EV buyers and emissions limits for car manufacturers. Major automakers are increasing EV production , and electric vehicles’ share of all new U.S. car sales rose sharply over the past two years, to 8.5%. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, younger adults, and people living in urban areas are among the most likely to say they would consider purchasing an EV. The 9% of U.S. adults who currently own a hybrid or electric vehicle are also particularly likely to consider an EV for their next purchase. A majority of this group (68%) says they are very or somewhat likely to seriously consider it. Among those who would consider purchasing an EV, about seven-in-ten say helping the environment (72%) and saving money on gas (70%) are major reasons why. A small share (12%) cite keeping up with the latest trends in vehicles as a major reason. Expectations for future electric vehicle infrastructure One potential obstacle to greater EV adoption is the availability of public charging stations. Currently, most EV owners charge their vehicles at home . Some who have used public chargers find that they are unreliable or limited in number. In September 2022, the Biden administration set aside $5 billion to create a network of EV charging stations . Americans express limited confidence that the country will build the necessary infrastructure to support large numbers of EVs on the roads. Some 17% say they are extremely or very confident this will happen, while 30% are somewhat confident. And 53% are not too or not at all confident. Republicans and GOP leaners are especially likely to doubt that the U.S. will build the charging stations and infrastructure needed to support EVs: 74% say they have not too much or no confidence at all in this. By comparison, 34% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same. Americans who are confident the country will build the necessary infrastructure are more likely than others to say they would consider purchasing an EV. Among those who are extremely or very confident that the U.S. will build the infrastructure needed to support EVs, 68% say they would be at least somewhat likely to consider purchasing an EV. Just 19% of those who are not too or not at all confident in future EV infrastructure say they are at least somewhat likely to consider purchasing an EV. Views on phasing out gasoline cars and trucks Accelerating the transition to EVs is a central part of President Joe Biden’s climate agenda. The administration has proposed new emission limits for automakers that would reduce the number of gas-powered cars and trucks they could sell. Some states have gone further, with plans to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035. However, the idea of phasing out the production of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035 faces more public opposition than support. About six-in-ten Americans (59%) say they oppose this, while 40% favor it. The share of Americans who favor phasing out gas-powered vehicles has declined 7 points since 2021. Support is down among both Democrats and Republicans. Currently, a majority of Democrats (64%) favor phasing out production of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, but 84% of Republicans oppose this. Partisans also have different emotional reactions to the idea of ending gas-powered vehicle production. A clear majority of Republicans (73%) say they would feel upset about it, but views among Democrats are more mixed. Some 37% say they would feel excited, while 43% would feel neutral and 20% would be upset. Note: This is an update to a post originally published June 3, 2021.

Contributors Akshi Goel, Menaka Samant 13 minute read 23 May 2022 Related topics Automotive Transportation eMobility Link copied Upvote Show resources EY Mobility Consumer Index 2022 study (pdf) Download 721 KB The top motivator in EV sales remains environmental concern, while penalties with ICE vehicles and EV incentives emerge. In brief Consumers are traveling less than in pre-COVID-19 times, but their preference for cars, especially electric vehicles, is growing. According to the latest Mobility Consumer Index, more than 50% planning to buy a car will choose either a fully electric, plug-in hybrid, or hybrid vehicle. Consumers continue to avoid public transport when they can, with usage remaining below 2020 levels. W ith many key markets consumed by the triple-whammy of shifting to an endemic COVID-19 strategy, whether to hold back or double down on climate change and the geopolitical challenges of the so-called “permacrisis,” perhaps it’s no surprise that the revival in consumer mobility hasn’t quite materialized as the industry might have wished for. So, what is happening, and what will it mean for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their suppliers and dealers, for transport authorities and policymakers? The headline findings from the EY Mobility Consumer Index (MCI) 2022 study (pdf) reveal that consumers are continuing to travel less than in pre-COVID-19 times but their preference for the car — and electric vehicles (EVs) in particular — is growing ever stronger. The MCI survey — now expanded to encompass nearly 13,000 consumers across 18 countries — is a major global EY research program that has tracked consumer mobility patterns and buying intentions since the start of the pandemic in 2020. While overall levels of travel reported remain lower when compared to the pre-pandemic benchmark, the number of consumers who say constant access to a personal car is very important to them is rising, and for the first time more than half of those surveyed, 52%, who intend to buy a car say they intend to choose either a fully electric, plug-in hybrid or hybrid vehicle. Conversely, consumers continue to avoid public transport when they can. After two years of heavy public health messaging around social distancing, usage remains stubbornly below 2020 levels, despite the efforts of many city authorities and transportation companies. In London and New York, for example, intensive ad campaigns are endeavoring to persuade travelers that it’s now safe to travel by bus, metro and train again. Consumer sentiment toward shared mobility (ride-hailing, car-sharing and car rental), broadly on the rise pre-pandemic, has also taken a hit from COVID-19. Journeys are down 11% in North America and 4% globally, a reversal of fortune driven partly by hygiene concerns and partly by rising journey costs and reduced availability. These trends present both an opportunity for OEMs and dealers to continue accelerating the shift to EVs, and an apparent threat to the sustainable transport ambitions of many city authorities and national governments, which depend on getting more people out of their cars and into public and shared modes of mobility. Squaring the circle may require a three-pronged approach from policymakers: leaning into consumer preferences for EVs where they can; dis-incentivizing the use of internal combustion engines (ICEs), especially in urban environments; and heavily incentivizing public transport in the short term to encourage greater use. Feeding into this picture are external factors around geopolitics — the war in Ukraine especially — and the consequences for ongoing supply chain disruption. Factors that have the potential to morph from short-term to long-term problems, which could have a substantial impact on OEMs ability to meet demand. (Chapter breaker) 1 Chapter 1 Mobility shift ahead Hybrid and remote working have changed travel patterns. Both work- and nonwork-related travel remain below pre-COVID-19 levels, down 11% and 8%, respectively, from 2021 expectation. This pattern looks set to remain at least in the medium term. Although offices are reopening, the new norms of flexible and remote working are impacting work travel. And increasingly digital lifestyles — at first imposed on consumers by the pandemic — now appear to have become active choices for many, and are a persistent factor in reducing non-work travel. Monthly work journeys by the two most popular modes — public transport and the car — are down 15% and 11%, respectively. Car rental is the only mode of transport that shows an increase on pre-COVID-19 levels of work-related travel, up 5% in 2022. How much more work-related travel will recover is a moot point; commuting appears to be in secular decline as a result of hybrid working. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed work from home at least once a week, up from less than half pre-COVID-19. And 31% do so at least three or four times a week, up from 17% pre-COVID-19. The overall travel picture is less of a bounce back and more of a steady recovery. Travel for both work and non-work purposes remains down 9% on average, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Despite lifts in official travel restrictions in many countries, consumers in 2022 are still choosing to travel less than they did before the pandemic. Travel appears to have become a discretionary activity, but when consumers do choose to travel, they prefer to do so in their personal car. Sixty-three percent say that constant access to a personal car is important to them, up from 57% in 2021. Hygiene factor here to stay When it comes to choosing modes of transport, hygiene and the perceived risk of infection remain top of the list of consumer concerns — 65% say it is very or extremely important — little changed from the 67% reported in 2021. Having encouraged their populations to stay at home and stay safe, governments and transport authorities may have inadvertently created a new and potentially limiting narrative around transport safety in consumers’ minds. On a sliding scale where the private car is regarded as the safest and most hygienic mode, public transport is represented as the least and shared mobility, such as taxis and ride-sharing options, occupy the middle ground. Public transport ‘‘satisfaction gap’’ If the car — especially the EV — is the “winner” in the minds of consumers, then public transport is surely the loser. Work journeys by public transport are down 15% globally compared to pre-COVID-19 levels and it’s a trend across all three major regions — Asia-Pacific, Europe and the North America. Work travel by public transport fell by a hefty 35% in Australia, 30% in Canada and 29% in Italy. Of the 18 countries in the survey, only one — India — reported a small increase in public transport usage, up 1%. While hybrid working may result in a secular decline in public transport use, the MCI research suggests that a “satisfaction gap” is currently the defining problem for consumers. This satisfaction gap places public transport in the unfortunate position of being best at delivering what consumers care least about and worst at delivering what they care most about. For example, consumers place the greatest importance on the perceived hygiene risk of using public transport, but their level of satisfaction with how that hygiene risk is managed is very low. Conversely, while levels of satisfaction with the ease of paying for public transport is very high (thanks to the widespread adoption of contactless payments) consumers do not regard ease of payment as a deciding factor. With sustainable transport a key plank in climate change initiatives, overcoming the satisfaction gap is emerging as a major challenge for city transport authorities. A carrot and stick approach may yield results, with 46% of consumers saying that free public transport would reduce their usage of private cars, and 38% saying that urban traffic charges would also lead then to take fewer journeys by car. Many city transport authorities — under severe financial pressure after many months of dramatically reduced passenger revenues — may be tempted by the revenue-boosting potential of road usage fees, which also offer the prospect of a hedge against falling incomes from vehicle and fuel taxes as EVs become more prevalent. Shared mobility shake-up Shared mobility (ride-sharing, car-sharing and car rental) — one of the pre-pandemic success stories when it comes to more sustainable urban travel in particular — has largely gone into reverse. Globally it has declined 4% on pre-COVID-19 levels, but in North America, shared mobility is down a hefty 11%. Consumer dissatisfaction with the hygiene of shared mobility emerges as a key factor, but satisfaction levels with the cost of travel and availability are also low. And with fuel prices up sharply — gas in the US is now 60% more expensive than in pre-COVID-19 times — those costs are likely to rise even further. Availability may also continue to suffer; reports from protesting ride-share drivers in the US suggest that some of them may leave the platform altogether as the cost of fuel continues to eat into their earnings. Some shared mobility providers have responded to falling demand by diversifying into last-mile deliveries, a sector that has flourished during the pandemic. Recent EY research estimates that booming last-mile demand will result in 36% more delivery vehicles on the streets of the top 100 global cities by 2030. Car rental is the only form of shared mobility to have grown on pre-pandemic levels, up 5% for work-related and 2% for nonwork-related travel, thanks largely to its perceived low hygiene risk. Further growth may be constrained by ongoing fleet shortages (largely due to stalled semi-conductor production globally), which are hitting availability and pushing up prices for consumers. (Chapter breaker) 2 Chapter 2 Buying boom beckons Consumers’ desire to own their own car continued to increase. That mobility shift is translating into a boom in demand for cars, whether they have ICE or EV drivetrains. The number of consumers planning to buy a car is rising fast. Forty-five percent of consumers say they intend to buy a car within the next 24 months, up 12% from the 2020 survey. Almost two-thirds of them (63%) intend to buy in the next 12 months. The majority will be new cars: 32% of all those intending to buy will choose a new car, compared to 12% who intend to buy used. The second year of the pandemic has seen a continued rise in consumers’ desire to own their own vehicle, with 63% in the 2022 survey saying that constant access to a personal car is very important to them (up from 57% last year) and 60% stating that their safety or well-being is best served by a personal vehicle (up from 52%). Only 16% say they would be open to car rental or subscription services as an alternative to buying. Demand for cars is expected to be highest in China, India and Mexico (where 75%, 75% and 66%, respectively, say they are ”extremely likely” or “somewhat likely” to buy), while Sweden, Singapore and Japan — 33%, 27% and 20%, respectively — will show the lowest level of demand. City dwellers are expected to account for most purchases in China and India, while in Europe those in rural and small towns will be more active buyers — perhaps indicative of the wider availability of public and shared mobility options in European cities. Electric cars are the stars But consumer confidence in EVs is rising fast and within that overall demand boom EVs are set to be the stars of the show. For the first time, over half of consumers — 52% — who intend to buy a car in the next 24 months say they will choose an EV or hybrid vehicle. That’s up 11% from 2021 and 22% in 2020. This growing consumer confidence in EV technology is also reflected by the jump in preference for fully electric vehicles, up from 7% in 2020 to 20% in 2022. The popularity of “stopgap” hybrid and plug-in hybrids also increased but at a much lower pace. As the preference for EVs grows, the motivations for choosing one are shifting. Green “early adopters,” whose main drivers are environmental, are now being joined by mainstream buyers with more prosaic financial concerns. The “pull” effect — the desire to be seen helping the environment by buying an EV — is now closely followed by the “push” of fears that congestion and pollution charging may hit the owners of ICE vehicles harder in the wallet. Environmental concerns are also a lower priority for second-time EV buyers than for those considering their first EV purchase. Consumers are becoming more comfortable with the EVs themselves, but charging infrastructure remains a barrier. Access to, and speed of, charging is emerging as the key inhibitor for would-be buyers, as other established concerns over high initial costs and range anxiety show evidence of subsiding. Consumer appetite for EVs is expected to be highest in Italy, Spain and Norway in Europe, and China, South Korea and Singapore in Asia-Pacific. While sentiment in North America is expected to lag the rest of the world, with below-average intention to buy EVs in the US, Canada and Mexico. (Chapter breaker) 3 Chapter 3 Can the industry keep up? Supply chains have been hit by delays, shortages, and economic and logistical disruption. Ever since the start of the pandemic, the mobility sector has faced two overarching questions: Is this a blip? And if it isn’t, which of the changes in travel behavior will be temporary and which will be permanent? There is still a good deal of uncertainty but some candidates for secular change are now emerging. Hybrid and home working appear to have become engrained in many markets, so commuting seems likely to become a weekly rather than daily activity. Meanwhile, digital lifestyles have become established and are having a similar dampening effect on non-work travel. However, the car remains the preferred mode for most consumers, and the EV is rapidly emerging as the mainstream new car choice of most buyers. But if the demand picture is solidifying, supply is another matter. Global auto supply chains have already been hit by delays and shortages especially in the semiconductor market and are now being further rocked by the geopolitical fallout of the war in Ukraine and the economic and logistical disruption that continues to spread. The hardest challenges for OEMs and dealers in the coming months may be around supplying enough cars to meet the rising demand. Spiraling gas prices and a dearth of microchips were blamed for recently reported steep drops in Q1 car sales in the US — down 26% year on year 1 — and in the UK where fleet sales fell 34% in the same period. 2 Some manufacturers have taken to contingency measures, such as reconfiguring design to use fewer chips or even shipping new cars with only a stopgap basic chipset installed to make their limited supplies go further. EV sales continue to rise faster than expected, boosted by rising consumer confidence in the technology as well as by fears over gas prices and road pricing. The EY Mobility Lens Forecaster predicts EV sales will dominate sales of all other drivetrains by 2033 — five years sooner than previously anticipated. But as production rises, EVs will not remain immune to many of the same supply constraints that plague the ICE market, as well as some that are equally intractable and all their own — particularly around battery raw materials and volumes. Trading off the tension between the supply and profitability of old ICE technologies vs. new EV and hybrids will remain a serious challenge as the transition accelerates. So, while the pandemic has crystalized consumer behavior around a preference for EVs combined with more conscious travel choices — and generally lower levels of mobility — for the auto industry, it has created a whole new dilemma around supply. Hard choices about whether to prioritize EV and hybrid drivetrains, or premium models over more affordable — but lower margin — vehicles may have to be made. Making progress in 2022 may not only be about asking the consumer “What kind of cars do you want to buy?”, but also about the industry asking itself “And what should we do if we can’t make enough of them?” How EY can help Mobility Lens Suite: Explore the future of mobility Find out where mobility is headed across the world with the help of EY propriety toolsets offered by the Mobility Lens Suite.

In this Deloitte report, we take a new approach to market segmentation and exemplify how to seize opportunities and manage risks. Before the COVID-19 pandemic shook up the automotive industry – along with every other industry – electric vehicles were moving steadily into the spotlight. The combined annual sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles tipped over the two-million-vehicle mark for the first time in 2019. This much-anticipated milestone may have become overshadowed by economic uncertainty and changed consumer priorities, but there is value in taking stock of the electric vehicle market even now. Learn More Explore the Future of Mobility collection Learn about Deloitte's services Go straight to smart. Get the Deloitte Insights app Since Deloitte last presented a forecast for electric vehicle (EV) sales , in January 2019, the EV market has made great strides, and not just in terms of sales. OEMs have invested billions to deliver new electrified models, from R&D to factory redesign. Consumer attitudes have evolved. Government interventions have pushed forward and pulled back. But then COVID-19 completely disrupted global sales and manufacturing. In this context, a revised forecast based on updated data is needed. By examining the current state of the EV market worldwide and noting the many factors fostering growth in various directions (Part 1 of this report), we have formed conclusions about how the market will take shape over the next decade. The significant growth of EVs leading up to 2030 will present major opportunities and challenges for traditional original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), new-entrant OEMs, captive finance companies and dealerships. In particular, traditional OEMs will find insights in this report that can help them re-prioritise their customers and strategies in a volatile competitive landscape. Paramount to seizing opportunities and managing risks is taking a new approach to market segmentation. We detail one such approach in Part 2 and apply it as a use case to one major market, the United Kingdom, to inform and inspire OEMs and other stakeholders globally. By letting today’s insights fuel the journey for the next ten years, we can accelerate beyond the obstacles the pandemic has brought and toward a future where EVs take centre stage. * In this report, we use the term electric vehicles (EVs) to refer to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). 1 Unless specifically stated, our analysis has considered both forms of drivetrain. BEVs are powered solely by batteries. They use an electric motor to turn the wheels and produce zero emissions. PHEVs are capable of zero-emission driving, typically between 20 and 30 miles, and can run on petrol or diesel for longer trips. As the name suggests, they need to be plugged in to an electricity supply to maximise their zero-emission capability. Part 1 – Global progress and forecast The EV market’s collective accomplishments over the past two years offer hope, despite the short-term impact of COVID-19: a pattern of continued growth, which is expected to be sustained throughout the 2020s. As BEV and PHEV sales surpassed two million vehicles in 2019 (see figure 1), EVs staked their claim on a 2.5 per cent share of all new car sales last year. Looking back at BEVs in 2019, they accounted for 74 per cent of global EV sales: an increase of six percentage points since 2018. This rise was partly stimulated by new, stricter European emissions standards that persuaded manufacturers to favour the production and sale of zero-emission vehicles. Another factor is the advanced state of the BEV market in China, compared to the rest of the world. Although BEVs are still the dominant EV technology in the United States and Europe, they command a smaller share of the market than in China. Since the last time Deloitte reported on EV sales, significant regional disparities in growth have surfaced. For example, sales of EVs grew by 15 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by the growth of BEVs in Europe (+93 per cent), China (+17 per cent) and ‘other’ regions (+22 per cent). In contrast, the United States market for BEVs fell 2 per cent (see figure 1). Then, in the first half of 2020, COVID-19 slowed down the growth rate of EV sales, or sent it into decline, across various regions. The speed of recovery is expected to vary by region. But generally speaking, the course seems clear for growth over the next decade, despite the potential lasting impact of COVID-19 on total car sales over the next three years. To understand how things might continue, we need to understand what’s been taking place across the various regional markets over the past year. EVs in regional markets Europe Europe’s EV sector saw significantly more growth than other regions in 2019. The Nordics and the Netherlands continued to lead the way; Norway achieved 56 per cent market share, and two of the top ten best-selling cars in Holland were BEVs. 3 The United Kingdom and some other countries reported triple-digit growth for the year. Favourable government policies and a change in consumer attitudes were the catalysts, driven primarily by growing concerns about climate change. Climate change rose to the top of many European governments’ agendas. The United Kingdom committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and proposed a ban on the sale of all polluting vehicles by 2035. 4 Germany plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by the end of 2020, by 55 per cent by the end of 2030 and up to 95 per cent by the end of 2050, compared to 1990 levels. 5 Despite the growth seen in 2019, mainstream adoption of EVs has been, so far, hindered by the limited number of models available to the European market and consumer perceptions regarding insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions. 6 The outbreak of COVID-19 and national lockdown measures impacted total car sales in Europe, as showrooms closed their doors and manufacturers halted production, but EV sales have held up well in comparison to their internal combustion engine (ICE) equivalents. In the first four months of 2020, in the European Union (EU), demand for new passenger cars contracted by 38.5 per cent, but in April 2020 – the first full month with COVID-19 restrictions in place – registrations of new passenger cars in the EU posted a year-on-year decline of 76.3 per cent, with some major markets reporting declines of over 95 per cent year-on-year. 7 But EV sales in Western Europe only fell by 31 per cent in April, with some countries actually reporting modest year-on-year growth – albeit against a low base. 8 China China continues to dominate the EV market, accounting for half of all vehicle sales. Sales in the second half of 2019 turned out lower than previously expected after some subsidies available to Chinese consumers were halved. 9 This considerably eroded the consumer demand for EVs, and total yearly sales dropped: PHEV sales fell by 9 per cent and BEV sales fell to a 17 per cent growth rate from 2018 to 2019. 10 On a positive note, a slowdown in the sales of ICE vehicles in the region means that the EV market share in China actually increased. China’s slowdown in the second half of 2019 affected global EV sales figures, but neither the slashed subsidies nor the impact of COVID-19 should impact EV sales significantly in the long term. Chinese authorities announced they would refrain from more subsidy cuts in 2020. 11 Meanwhile, other incentives (for example, number-plate privileges in Tier 1 cities) remain, investment is being made in China’s charging infrastructure and there is a continued focus on encouraging Chinese manufacturers to produce and market EVs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in place, China saw a 45 per cent decline in passenger car sales in Q1 2020. 12 EV sales fell at a faster rate than the total market (by 56 per cent), as consumers stayed home and showrooms closed their doors. 13 But the rate of recovery has been swift. By March 2020, Chinese factories had recovered to achieve a production rate of 75 per cent, with 86 per cent of employees returning to work. By April 2020, production had basically been restored to pre-pandemic levels. Although sales have remained depressed in certain Chinese provinces, recovery has been accelerated by pent-up demand, favourable policies put in place by Chinese authorities and the ability to purchase cars online; total sales actually reflected year-on-year growth in April. This brings hope for a ‘V-shaped’ recovery in China, with many individual EV manufacturers already benefitting from the release of new models. 14 United States After an encouraging start to 2019, falling fuel prices in the United States (a market that already enjoys comparatively cheap private transportation) led to a disappointing second half of the year for EV sales. The United States EV market is almost singlehandedly being carried by the success of the Tesla Model 3 – alone responsible for almost half of all EV sales. 15 As in Europe and China, United States car sales fell sharply in the first three months of 2020 as the pandemic took a toll on demand; job losses increased and large swathes of the population were ordered to stay home. The recovery in EV sales is likely to be slower in the United States than in other major regions, as manufacturers delay the launch of new cars and consumers take advantage of low oil prices. Rest of the world The world outside Europe, China and the United States is lagging behind in terms of EV sales, for various reasons: a lack of government commitment to EVs, insufficient or unsuitable charging infrastructure, unavailability of EVs and cultural differences regarding mobility models. For example, Japan is a major global car market, but new car sales are dominated by domestic OEMs that have not yet developed the same range of EVs as their European and Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, India, like many markets, is dominated by mass- and low-cost mobility models: an area that OEMs haven’t been able to penetrate so far, because of EVs’ comparative higher price. 2030 sales forecast With one eye firmly on progress so far, Deloitte has analysed the most recent indicators to develop an up-to-date prediction of the EV market for the next ten years. We know that BEVs already outperform PHEVs globally, and predict that by 2030, BEVs will likely account for 81 per cent (25.3 million) of all new EVs sold. By contrast, PHEV sales are expected to reach 5.8 million by 2030. A recovery from COVID-19 will see ICE vehicles return to growth, up to 2025 (81.7 million), then experience a decline in market penetration thereafter. Our global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales (see figure 2) . Annual car sales are unlikely to reach pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024. However, the pace of recovery is forecasted to be a result of a slowdown in ICE sales; EVs will continue to have a positive trajectory during the COVID-19 recovery period and may well end up capturing a disproportionate share of the market in the short term. Deloitte expects that by 2030 China will hold 49 per cent of the global EV market, Europe will account for 27 per cent, and the United States will hold 14 per cent. The share of new car sales taken up by EVs will vary considerably across markets (see figure 3). We forecast China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48 per cent by 2030 – almost double that of the United States (27 per cent), and Europe should achieve 42 per cent. But this doesn’t tell the whole story. Growth in Northern and Western Europe is expected to outstrip that in Southern and Eastern Europe as wealthier countries (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Nordic countries) likely invest more in infrastructure and offer greater cash and tax incentives to accelerate initial growth. EV growth beyond 2030 Beyond 2030, we expect the rate of growth in EV sales to slow. Some markets will be unable to support the transition to EVs in the same way that wealthier nations will over the next decade. Consider that, beyond 2030, one of the key factors in sustaining growth will be the implementation of suitable charging infrastructure. This requires multi-billion-dollar capital investments – achievable in some markets through a combination of public and private investment, but unlikely to be achieved uniformly around the world. In countries that cannot invest in charging infrastructure, we expect the market for ICE vehicles to remain for some time. Four factors driving growth Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. Factor 1 – Changing consumer sentiment Consumer demand will fuel the growth of EVs but, at the moment, there are several reasons consumers haven’t swapped their ICE vehicles for equivalent EVs. However, as the barriers to adoption are rapidly removed, EVs are increasingly becoming a realistic and viable option. Figure 4 shows how consumer concerns regarding BEVs have changed, and in many instances diminished, since 2018. From 2018 to 2020, there were some noticeable changes in consumer attitudes toward EVs. Concerns over the cost/price premium have diminished in every country apart from China (+ two percentage points), which has seen cuts in EV subsidies. Driving range has remained the number-one concern in Germany, and became number one in France, but there are now fewer consumers citing it as a concern in those two markets. Elsewhere, the lack of charging infrastructure has become the top priority for consumers, reflecting the possibility that they are starting to see EVs as a realistic option and are considering the practicalities of ownership. Over the next few years, we expect some barriers to be completely removed. EVs’ driving range is already comparable to that of ICE vehicles; price has already reached parity, if you consider subsidies in various markets and total cost of ownership; and the number of models available is increasing. As EV sales continue to grow and consumers see more of them on the roads, or travel in EVs owned by family or friends, we expect personal experiences to trump concerns. The expected proliferation of commercial EVs (such as vans, trucks, lorries) should also play a part in reassurance, as will the rise of mass-transit options (such as electric buses). Measures that governments take in their COVID-19 recovery plans could also affect consumer sentiment. As part of a $146 billion economic recovery plan, Germany has designated $2.8 billion to EV charging infrastructure and announced new legislation that will oblige all fuel stations to have an EV charging point. 19 This is significant progress in a country where driving range and lack of charging infrastructure are the two biggest barriers for consumers. China has made similar commitments, announcing an additional $378 million investment in charging infrastructure as part of a COVID-19 recovery plan. 20 Factor 2 – Policy and legislation Government intervention continues to play an important role in driving EV sales, as shown by the successes in Norway, fluctuating sales in the Netherlands and changing fortunes of the Chinese EV market. 21 Not only are there economic benefits for states that support a transition to electric, but the positive environmental impact has made the widespread adoption of EVs a necessary step toward achieving climate-change goals, such as those of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Several policies and regulations are helping encourage the growth of EV adoption: Fuel economy and emission targets These differ across markets and are under constant review and consultation by governments. Recent Deloitte analysis shows that with the phasing-in of new European CO 2 emission targets, which will be fully implemented in 2021 and bring punitive fines, 22 half of car manufacturers are facing related penalty payments. They’ll owe a total of $0.5 billion in 2020 and $3.7 billion in 2021, 23 which could cost the industry approximately $39 billion, based on recent emission levels. 24 Such government intervention is shaping OEM strategy: to avoid fines and reputational fallout, OEMs are seeking ways to reduce emissions through increased electrification. City access restrictions City governments have led the way on imposing bans, or punitive taxes, on users of older combustion engines, addressing increasing concerns about toxic air pollution.  In 2019 more cities followed the path already taken in Madrid, Mexico City, Rome and Seattle: Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona all took action to reduce the number of ICE vehicles on the road. Several United Kingdom cities also brought forward plans for bans and zero-/low-emission zones. Throughout 2020 we expect this trend to continue as cities worldwide grapple with air pollution and confront their relationships with combustion engines – and private cars in general. Financial incentives Many governments have offered compelling financial incentives to make the electric switch, such as providing cash subsidies to consumers buying low-emission vehicles, reducing taxes on EVs and increasing or maintaining taxes on ICE vehicles. But as EVs reach price parity with ICE vehicles, some governments have explored rolling back such incentives; this can have a dramatic and immediate effect on EV sales, as seen by the recent fluctuations in sales in China and the Netherlands. Instead, in light of COVID-19, the need to stimulate total new car purchases has prompted a range of new financial incentives introduced across major markets, some of which clearly favour EVs. For example, in Germany the government has temporarily lowered VAT from 19 per cent to 16 per cent on low-emission vehicles and doubled existing subsidies to almost $7,000 on EVs costing less than $45,000. 25 In France, private consumers who buy electric cars (that cost up to $50,000) now receive an almost $8,000 incentive, up from around $7,000; those looking to get rid of their old cars now receive double the previous value offered by a scrappage scheme, which was designed to get less-efficient models off the road. 26 Under both schemes, a consumer replacing an older car for a new EV could be eligible for up to $13,500. Meanwhile, in China, EV subsidies and tax break policies set to expire in 2020 were extended to 2022 in a direct response to the economic impact of COVID-19. 27 In the long term, the viability of financial incentives will need to be reconsidered as the economic recovery from the pandemic becomes clearer and governments try to manage other concerns, such as potential lost fuel-tax revenues. Factor 3 – OEM vehicle strategy In the past year, some prominent OEMs have announced strategic commitments to EVs (see figure 5). New models have been announced, production targets increased and sales targets moved forward and multiplied. In the short term, COVID-19 may hinder some OEMs in their reach for these targets, as they conserve cash and divert investments elsewhere in the business. But in the long term, we expect these targets to continue as priorities for OEMs. The impact of the investment and targets shown in figure 5 will represent a seismic market shift over the next decade, in terms of availability and affordability of models. Availability of models Recent company announcements have made it clear that there will be substantially more EV models commercially available over the next decade than previously thought. According to statistics cited by the European Federation for Transport and Environment, Europe should expect 33 new models in 2020, 22 in 2021, 30 in 2022 and 33 in 2023. 29 This means that BEV models available in the EU will surpass 100 in 2022 and reach 172 in 2025. In the United States, IHS Markit predicts there will be 130 available models by 2026, offered by 43 brands. 30 Affordability of models Achieving price parity with, or even savings over, ICE vehicles will play a big role in speeding up EV adoption, especially as model ranges and marketing priorities adapt to manufacturer emission targets. A key takeaway from monthly sales figures in 2019 is just how sensitive consumers are to the relative total cost of ownership when it comes to EVs versus ICE vehicles. This includes upfront costs (as seen in the Chinese EV sales drop when subsidies were cut) and short-term costs, like fuel (as seen in the United States, where EV sales dipped right along with fuel prices). Based on recent company announcements, over the next decade we expect to see EVs – particularly BEVs – become available at the low-cost end of the market, but the roll-out of EVs across all parts of the market is likely to be uneven. Even with more OEMs offering affordable EV models, consumers are still unwilling to pay a premium for an EV instead of its ICE equivalent. However, we expect the existing price premium associated with EVs to be consigned to history sooner rather than later. In some cases, the total cost of owning a BEV or PHEV for private buyers is already less than for the ICE equivalent, and the annual cost of ownership is also balancing out. Meanwhile, for businesses and customers that use company car schemes, favourable tax schemes have already created an environment where EVs can offer savings. Factor 4 – The role of corporate companies We are seeing an increasingly important role for corporates to support the transition to EVs, using the three factors highlighted above to their advantage. Sales of new cars to businesses represents a significant proportion of all cars sold. For instance, Deloitte previously predicted that corporates would account for 63 per cent of total new car sales across Western Europe by 2021. 31 In the past year, purpose has continued rising to the top of the corporate agenda, with an increasing number of companies seeking to differentiate themselves by acting as a force for positive change. Because travel is a major avenue for businesses to alleviate emissions, more and more companies are considering how they can support a shift to EVs. Traditional company car schemes are ripe for reinvention: By exploring broader mobility options, businesses are finding value not just in emissions reduction, but in cost savings and improved employee satisfaction. Government tax schemes that target company cars put the emphasis firmly on businesses to lead the way in the shift to EVs. In light of COVID-19, investment in fleets has stalled dramatically as corporates reduce their expenditure and prioritise other investments. Before a comprehensive transition to EVs can take place, business confidence needs to be restored and funds made available again. Corporates also need to consider how fundamental changes to how and where work is done will affect the structure of their mobility schemes. Part 2: New landscape, new approach In our previous report, we identified unprecedented levels of competition that threatened incumbent OEMs as the shift to EVs began taking shape. 32 That threat has reduced somewhat over the past year as those OEMs doubled down on their investment in the sector, and as the reality of competing in the automotive industry hit home for new market entrants. In China, for instance, 486 registered EV manufacturers have raised over $18 billion in funding since 2011, but their collective manufacturing capacity is unsustainable – considering all reasonable sales forecasts. 33 As a result, we expect to see consolidation of the market; some new entrants will fail, and the number of partnerships and joint ventures between Chinese manufacturers and Western OEMs will rise. Outside China, many established OEMs are actually investing in start-ups to take advantage of the capabilities they’ve built. 34 Despite the marginal decline in the threat from new entrants and start-ups, there hasn’t been a consistent speed at which incumbent OEMs have reacted to, and planned for, the growth of EVs. The ability of some manufacturers to swiftly accommodate the future of EVs, and trade in their traditional approaches for creative thinking, means that the competitive landscape will likely re-arrange itself accordingly. Segmenting the market In an increasingly competitive marketplace, all automotive industry stakeholders – established OEMs, new entrants, captive finance houses and dealerships, for example – should consider how they can convince consumers to purchase an EV – or, specifically, their EV. The obvious choices are to ensure current customers remain loyal during the transition from ICE to EV, or to convert new customers to an EV brand or product. A valuable exercise to achieve either objective (or both) is through a refreshed customer segmentation approach: Targeting consumers by their behaviour and needs. In the sections that follow, we’ve used the United Kingdom as a use case for market segmentation, based on Monitor Deloitte’s GrowthPath ® Action Segmentation ® . 35 Although there are significant differences worldwide when it comes to the structure of the automotive industry, the retail market, the readiness for EV adoption and consumer attitudes and behaviours, the principles of segmentation outlined below can be applied to many major markets. For those where they cannot, the central tenet remains true: Refreshing your consumer segmentation approach can benefit EV sales, stimulating the overall growth of the market. Use case: United Kingdom In November 2019 Deloitte conducted a survey of 1,496 United Kingdom residents who are thinking of buying a car in the next three years. More than half of respondents were considering an EV – significantly more than those considering a petrol or diesel car (35 per cent). But their intention doesn’t mean an automatic conversion into purchases. Although sales of EVs in the United Kingdom are rising, BEVs and PHEVs combined still only commanded a 3.1 per cent share of the market in 2019. 36 It’s clear that there is an opportunity here to put consumers under the microscope, discerning certain characteristics that will aid in market segmentation and boost EV conversion. Our goal of meaningful and actionable segmentation begins with the United Kingdom survey results: Based on the opinions of these buyers, we can create a segmentation framework based on driving behaviour and a mix of consumer and demographic variables (see figure 6). In the United Kingdom, the most prominent differences in behaviour and attitudes identified in our survey were determined by how old a consumer is, how much they spend each month and whether they currently own a car or not. Behaviour and attitudes also varied significantly, based on how respondents plan on using their next car and the distances they regularly travel. From the framework, we can see nine potential segments that can categorise future car buyers, all with various meaningful characteristics, behaviours and needs to target and address (see figure 7). To calculate an approximate market size for each segment, a recent industry study offers insight: 56 per cent of adults (17 years and older) believe they will definitely or probably purchase a car in the next three years – a total addressable market of about 30 million people. 38 * Using the annual average GBP/USD exchange rate for 2019, <£299/month = <$382/month and +£300/month = +£383/month Key behavioural differences This kind of segmentation provides a detailed understanding of modern automotive consumers’ needs, wants and behaviours. Before defining the nuances of each United Kingdom segment by creating Customer Portraits®, let’s consider the obvious differences in key behaviours and attitudes: Brand loyalty: Segments E and G are the most brand loyal, usually buying the same brand (47 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively, versus the average 27 per cent); this translates to their intended purchasing behaviour – both types of consumer believe they would buy an EV from their current brand (48 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively, versus the average 37 per cent). Segments F and I are most likely to consider switching brands to find a more suitable EV (47 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, versus the average 36 per cent). Segment A is most likely to consider choosing either an EV start-up brand (42 per cent versus the average 25 per cent) or an existing brand not currently associated with automotive products (12 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Research: Segment E is most likely to already know what car they intend to buy prior to researching (50 per cent versus the average 28 per cent). Segment A and Segment I are the least likely to know (40 per cent each versus the average 26 per cent). Ownership benefits: Segment B is the most likely to think environmental reasons are the biggest advantage to EVs (22 per cent versus the average 17 per cent). Segment A considers driving experience to be the biggest advantage (36 per cent versus the average 27 per cent). Price sensitivity: Most segments would pay more for an EV. Segment E is the most likely to pay £100 ($128) or more per month (15 per cent versus the average 5 per cent). Segments F and I are the least likely to pay more for an EV (28 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, versus the average 23 per cent). These characteristics are worthy of careful consideration in the next step of the segmentation exercise: building Customer Portraits. Customer Portraits: Driving a change in behaviour Building a Customer Portrait for each target segment invites insights into key aspects of a consumer that, when viewed collectively, explain their behaviour. It outlines what they do and why they do it, identifying the motives for, and barriers to, behavioural change – or lack thereof. Ultimately, this allows an OEM, captive finance company or dealership to effectively target and encourage desired behaviours by revising marketing and activation strategies. A detailed analysis of survey responses and additional qualitative research informs the individual profiles. Each illustrates a typical consumer in a segment, defines their key characteristics, and then uses the distilled information to present ways that persona can be specifically targeted. As an example, we built three Customer Portraits for segments of United Kingdom–based consumers, complete with suggested actions for OEMs. Prioritise to drive purchases Having developed these nuanced Customer Portraits, OEMs and other stakeholders can drill down into the observations to draw conclusions about who is likely to buy what. This will highlight segments to prioritise and where marketing and proposition development budgets can be deployed most effectively. Some segments are naturally more interested in purchasing an EV than others; OEMs and their partners may look to target them first – if the right product mix, capabilities and insight are available to do so effectively. In our United Kingdom example (see figure 8), Segment G is the most likely to consider buying an EV (69 per cent versus the average 50 per cent) – perhaps not surprising, given the relatively higher price tag of EVs up to this point and the greater likelihood of those consumers having off-street parking (77 per cent versus the average 72 per cent). Segment C is also significantly more likely than other segments to consider an EV, but these consumers’ motives seemingly relate to the distance they regularly travel and their awareness of potential ownership savings (e.g., through lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance costs). The impact of COVID-19 on consumer behaviour Deloitte’s segmentation of the United Kingdom market was performed prior to the emergence of COVID-19. It is important to consider how shifting priorities, in light of the pandemic, may affect the different segments. In the United Kingdom, lockdown measures took consumers out of the automotive retail market for an extended period of time. Even as restrictions are eased, financial concerns may shape how people re-engage with the sector, and to what extent. Lingering health concerns will likely also play a pivotal role in consumer behaviour. Short-term demand for EVs is likely to change, within and across segments. According to consumer research carried out by Deloitte bi-weekly, throughout the pandemic, close to half of United Kingdom consumers now plan to own their current vehicles for longer than originally intended. 42 (The number of consumers aged 18 to 34, or 55 and over, who expressed this sentiment is marginally lower than other age groups.) With work travel being a key component of our segmentation, it is also worth considering how COVID-19 is changing how we travel to and for work. The recent research highlights that over two-thirds of consumers plan to limit their use of public transportation in the future, and well over half plan to limit their use of ride-sharing apps. In the short term, this will likely accelerate demand for cheap second-hand cars, but in the long term this could translate into increased demand for EVs within Segment A. COVID-19 might also prove to be a catalyst for the growth of online sales within different segments. Our COVID-19–related research shows that a fifth of consumers now plan to buy their next vehicle online (if possible). This figure is consistently higher among 18- to 34-year-olds, suggesting that Segments B, C, D and E could all demonstrate a significant jump in demand for online services. Checklist for the journey ahead Ultimately, it’s up to all stakeholders in the automotive industry to consider how they can best serve their prioritised segments. Consumer interest has been sparked, and the onus now lies with new-entry OEMs, captive finance companies, dealerships and, especially, established OEMs to feed the fire. To maximise the opportunities presented by the growing demand for EVs, business leaders in all regions should examine the priorities they have defined according to the segmentation exercise and ask themselves the key questions shown below. The answers may help soften the blow COVID-19 is making on the market and/or aid in the recovery. They’ll also highlight how well-positioned the business is to help accelerate growth in the EV market and reap the benefits when EVs take centre stage. Established OEMs: How well does our existing model range fit the segments we deem high priority, and on which segments should we focus future models? Do we have the right EV supply chains and order-to-delivery capabilities to realise our promises to customers, especially in the initial launch phase? Can we support, or even drive, change in our franchised dealerships by delivering more compelling in-store EV marketing and increasing model availability? How do we make sure that our franchised dealers are aligned with our EV strategy? How can we incentivise them to sacrifice the long-term, recurring profit of an ICE vehicle sale to support the growth of EVs? How well does our current branding support new EV model (and broader proposition) launches? Do we have the right marketing and campaign approaches to target specific segments? Do we have sufficient in-house capabilities, or the right partnerships, to offer a compelling charging proposition? How do we improve our current omni-channel experience? What innovative retail formats, online and bricks and mortar, should we invest in? New-entrant OEMs: Some consumer segments will be identified as ‘easier wins’ to build brand and customer intimacy, so how can our product launch plans target these most effectively? How can new business models, unconstrained by legacy IT systems and physical footprints, provide an enhanced customer experience as compared to traditional OEMs? Will Chinese new entrants need different strategies for launching in Europe? How will we continue to engage with customers after a purchase, to receive product feedback and incorporate it into a refreshed sales strategy? How will we manage the after-sales business without established dealer networks? Are there additional partners that could support market entry and offer a more compelling value proposition, such as energy providers? Captive finance companies: Which financing offers will appeal to which segment? What is the best way to manage the wave of incoming ICE vehicles and realise the expected residuals on these? Which finance solutions will address customers’ apprehension about switching (e.g., combined vehicle and wallbox-charger financing, or social offers, like cinema tickets)? Do we have a compelling offering for our fleet customers to gain regulatory and tax benefits? How can our marketing convincingly address ‘range anxiety’ and other barriers to EV ownership? Do we have the capability to understand and act on existing EV customers’ feedback and learnings to strengthen our retention programmes? Dealerships: Can we effectively communicate the benefits of EVs to our customers? Do we understand which segments want to learn about environmental benefits and which are exclusively interested in technology and performance? Do we have the assets to support a more targeted approach to marketing? Do we offer a financially compelling reason to switch to EVs while maintaining an appropriate margin on the vehicles? Can we fully explain all the available government grants and financial packages available for EVs? Can we offer ongoing maintenance and service packages or deals that include funding for at-home charge points? Is our business set up to handle an increase in online sales? Can we offer collection and delivery services? Can we provide test drives to online customers? Can we use our existing regional footprint to effectively fulfil online sales? Is our business set up to deal with the potential loss of recurring revenue (after-sales service and parts)? Are our marketing and sales strategies fully aligned with those of our OEM partners?

Contact us Consumer attitudes towards electric vehicles: Effects of product user stereotypes and self-image congruence Roger Bennett ( Kingston University London , Kingston, London, UK ) Rohini Vijaygopal (Business School, Open University , Milton Keynes, UK ) European Journal of Marketing ISSN : 0309-0566 Article publication date: 7 February 2018 Issue publication date: 29 March 2018 Downloads 7205 Abstract Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of gamification on connections between consumers’ self-image congruence in relation to the purchasers of an environmentally friendly product electric vehicles (EVs) and their possession of a stereotype of EV owners as being “unconventional”, and their attitudes towards EVs, having regard to their levels of environmental concern and prior knowledge of EVs. Additionally, the research explored the link between attitudes towards and willingness to purchase EVs. Design/methodology/approach Participants completed a questionnaire and an Implicit Association Test (IAT) both before and after playing a computer game wherein the player assumed the identity of an EV driver. A structural equation model was constructed to predict attitude to EVs. The relationship between attitude and willingness to purchase was examined via a conditional process analysis. Findings The experience of playing the game improved the favourability of the respondents’ stereotype of EV owners by an average of 19 per cent, and their attitude towards EVs by 17 per cent. Self-image congruence in relation to EV ownership increased on the average by 14 per cent and reported EV product knowledge by 8 per cent. However, willingness to purchase an EV was not substantially affected. The link between attitude and willingness to purchase was weak, but was significantly moderated by stereotype favourability and self-image congruence with EV owners. Research limitations/implications As with any IAT study, it was necessary to pre-specify a particular form of stereotype. Future research could employ alternative stereotypes. The investigation took place in a single country and involved a single environmentally friendly product. Practical implications Gamification has much potential for helping manufacturers and government agencies to stimulate the mass market for EVs. To negate unfavourable images of EV owners, marketing communications promoting EVs might usefully employ celebrities, sports personalities and/or leading political figures as exemplars of the types of people who drive electric cars. Originality/value The research is the first to explore the effects of gamification on product user self-image congruence and stereotype formation. It is novel both in its employment of an IAT to measure the consumer stereotype of an environmentally friendly product and in its examination of the moderating influences of stereotype and product user self-image congruence on the attitude-willingness to purchase link.

Haeusler Director I Innovation, Strategy, & Transformation @EV Mobility and New Retail I Global Solution Lead Published Sep 5, 2022 + Follow The growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to a new buying experience for customers and is influencing a change in driving behaviors. Brands are working harder to understand the needs of this new generation of consumers and manage their expectations more effectively. In the following interview, Robert M. Häusler, Director New Retail Model and EV Strategy at Global Sales, MSX, discusses how businesses must adapt to changing consumer profiles and attitudes towards EVs. “The automotive industry today competes within a technology-driven, experience-rich environment in which EV companies are thriving.” How have EVs inspired brands to change the way they appeal to consumers and what are ‘new generation’ customers? Historically, cars were sold on their performance and reliability. Manufacturers focused on changing the consumer’s attitude towards their products or tailoring their marketing to their ‘ideal’ customer, rather than making the product fit the consumer. While some of these approaches play a role today, a user-centric perspective is now crucial. Businesses must understand the needs of consumers and tailor their offerings accordingly. In the early days of EV sales, buyers were often higher-income customers willing to pay more or experience the restrictions of lower-range travel to own a vehicle. But the EV customer persona has changed. The buying demographic has grown from this niche audience to a larger group of consumers with more mainstream values and expectations. Millennials are 2.5 times more likely to be early adopters of technology than older generations, being both drivers and consumers of it. And US-based research from Pew Research Center, conducted in 2019, found that 30% of millennials live with a spouse and their own child. This generation is made up of people who not only demand the latest technology, but who have also reached a more family-oriented, financially stable period in their lives. For this reason, it’s a highly influential demographic that could represent a tipping point for many brands’ EV success. Today's EV companies are embracing the values of this new generation with their customer-oriented products and services. Tesla’s business model relies on a direct-to-customer approach, with a seamless, low-effort sales journey, for example. And Polestar offers a hassle-free online purchase process alongside a mobile app which gives owners access to a range of connected features. How do EV-buyer personas, and therefore customer experiences, differ from those of ICE consumers? The automotive industry today competes within a technology-driven, experience-rich environment in which EV companies are thriving. EV customers value different product features than ICE drivers, and the way they think about using their vehicle is also different. They may plan their travel around charging availability, for example, and this affects the way manufacturers position their products. When identifying buyer personas, brands can align EV customers’ attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors to their buying behaviors and intentions. Various factors contribute to consumers' interest in purchasing an EV, such as their awareness and attitude towards the vehicles. Although positive attitudes towards electric vehicles may make consumers more inclined to make a purchase, there are still many other factors involved. The availability of local charging infrastructure, and the capability to charge a vehicle at home, are crucial for an EV to be a feasible purchase for most consumers. Furthermore, EVs are often more expensive than their internal combustion engine counterparts, which may mean some consumers are unable to afford these vehicles. Additionally, the influence of external sources, such as information online and the opinions of other people can impact on a consumer’s plan to purchase an EV. The association between EVs and a greener future has boosted consumers’ purchase intentions, and research by AlixPartners shows an increase in battery electric vehicle (BEV) interest can also be attributed to the influence of family and friends. Meanwhile, the concept of being part of a club or community is also persuading potential buyers. In these communities, other EV users act as advocates, helping those in earlier stages of the buying process by sharing their knowledge across social media channels or community forums. Many brands now recognize the importance of these communities in helping prospective buyers understand EVs and in alleviating concerns about their buying decisions. How can brands extend that community to a wider audience? One UK-based survey found that over 90% of EV and PHEV drivers can charge their vehicle at home. These figures suggest that people without access to home charging are less inclined to consider an EV, highlighting one of the challenges the industry has yet to overcome. But similar challenges were experienced by early users of the first gasoline cars who struggled to find fuel as suppliers were limited. And in the early days of mobile phones, hardware costs and network rates were high compared to the affordable contracts of today. In future, EV contracts may deliver low-cost hardware and bundled, flat rates for elements such as charging. And they’ll offer more additional benefits, such as in-vehicle apps, community platforms and personalization features. EV brands must establish a deep understanding of their audience, and services and products must be easy to consume. Brands will need to offer promotions for home or public charging stations, making charging affordable and convenient. The industry is already welcoming innovative ways to ease the issue of charging. Chinese electric mobility company NIO, for example, has introduced battery swapping, enabling a driver to easily swap a drained battery for a fully charged one in minutes. Ultimately, brands are building cost-effective, scalable solutions that can be adapted to the industry’s changing needs and offer sustainable new sources of revenue. What is the relevance of customer touchpoints and how do they contribute to a better EV-buying journey? OEMs face many challenges in their transition to a world of electric and autonomous vehicles, new mobility models and greater connectivity. Transformation is complex and expensive, and it’s hard to know which investments will pay off, leaving some businesses nervous about the choices they make. But digitalization, new consumer behaviors and better information access have led to an explosion in customer touchpoints, and effective analysis of these can improve customer experiences and boost revenue. All touchpoints are important in generating enthusiasm and emotion, but today, digital options are increasingly valuable. The AlixPartners 2021 EV Consumer Sentiment Survey reveals that BEV buyers are around three times more likely to prefer an online experience than those who are unlikely to buy a BEV. Touchpoint analysis involves the creation of a customer touchpoint map, on which all contact points are categorized according to criteria such as manufacturer, regional and local conditions, and industry specifics. Touchpoint mapping assesses each contact to determine how well it meets EV customer requirements and how effective an experience it offers. This way, the business can tailor its touchpoints to successfully influence the customer at crucial moments in their buying journey. Digital touchpoints such as chatbots, voice-bots, or avatars are vital in easing customer communication pressures on businesses, gathering data and generating leads. They use artificial intelligence to detect keywords for smarter, more accurate responses to customer enquiries, helping people book a test drive or browse product ranges, for example. Bots also offer immediate support around the clock and increase brand awareness through targeted offers. The speed at which EVs have progressed in a relatively short time is a clear indicator of the scale of innovation the industry can expect in the years to come. Early EVs had a range of around 100 km and now some brands, such as Lucid Group and Mercedes-Benz, are developing vehicles with a range of up to 1,000 km. We’ll also see many new charging options, greater connectivity, more transparent data, autonomy, and convenience. These factors, and the undeniable benefits of EVs to the environment, are all contributing to the rapid rise in EV acceptance and sales.

Survey Shows Continued Growth in Consumer Sentiment Toward Electric Vehicles News provided by TrueCar.com 13 Sep, 2022, 09:00 ET Share this article Share to X Share this article Share to X Percentage of Consumers Likely to Purchase an EV Surges 7% since March Gas Prices Among Strongest Drivers Toward EV Consideration Concerns About Cost to Charge Drop 12% SANTA MONICA, Calif. , Sept. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In concert with the opening of the 2022 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , TrueCar, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRUE ), the easiest, most efficient and transparent online destination for buying and selling new and used vehicles, refreshed its national consumer attitude survey from March regarding electric vehicles. The survey uncovered a continued growth in consumer interest and willingness to consider an EV as their next vehicle purchase. Key indicators across the board show consumers are becoming more comfortable with EVs as a viable option, and that while fears regarding charging costs and range anxiety still exist, they are lessening. ""Consumers across the nation are showing a growing acceptance toward considering an EV as their next vehicle purchase,"" said Mike Darrow , President and CEO of TrueCar. ""Since March 2022 , the percentage of consumers reporting they would consider an EV as their next purchase grew from 52% to 59%."" August 2022 National Consumer EV Survey Highlights: Consumers' likelihood to purchase an EV as their next vehicle continues to grow EV Considerers (percent somewhat or extremely likely ) up from 52% to 59% EV Rejectors (percent somewhat or extremely unlikely ) shrunk from 24% to 19% Despite gas prices leveling off, those prices continue to drive EV consideration Almost 1/3 (31%) of consumers now say they are much more likely to consider purchasing or leasing an EV due to gas prices, up from 27% in March More consumers now say they would purchase an EV if it met their range needs, up from 73% to 77% The proportion of consumers concerned about the cost to charge an EV dropped dramatically, from 54% to 42% However, not all areas of the country are as robustly leading the charge toward EVs. TrueCar focused in on Detroit -Metro area consumers ahead of the opening of its annual North American International Auto Show which carries a heavy focus on the industry transformation toward EVs. ""Our focus on Detroit area consumers showed a lower percentage of people willing to consider EVs as a next purchase,"" said Darrow. ""This might be attributable to the area's strong ties to the auto industry and its love of performance vehicles or could be an indication that the middle of the country lags behind the coasts in its appetite for EVs."" August 2022 Detroit-Area Consumer EV Survey Highlights: Detroit residents are significantly less likely to purchase an EV in the future Only 49% report being likely ( somewhat or extremely ) to purchase an EV in the future (vs. 59% nationwide) Part of this reluctance could be up to exposure. Detroit residents have significantly less experience with EVs: two-thirds (66%) have neither owned nor driven one in the past (vs. 57% nationwide) They are less likely to consider an EV specifically due to the rise in gas prices, perhaps reflecting lower prices in the Detroit metro than in many other areas 23% report being much more likely to purchase an EV due to high gas prices (vs. 31% nationwide) To help narrow the consumer education gap on purchasing and owning EVs, TrueCar is now providing informational guides for consumers that are searching and buying EVs through its online site www.truecar.com .

Another 43% of U.S. adults say they might consider buying an electric vehicle in the future, while 41% unequivocally say they would not. ###Embeddable### Electric vehicles, or EVs, were first invented in the 19 th century, long before gas-powered vehicles came on the scene. They have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade, with the emergence of Tesla’s all-electric fleet of vehicles and traditional automobile manufacturers introducing their own electric models. While EVs are significantly more expensive than conventional vehicles to purchase, proponents say the long-term savings on fuel and less upkeep of electric vehicles make them a better choice financially. In addition to cost, proponents of EVs say they help with climate change because they do not emit greenhouse gases and pollutants to the same degree that gas vehicles do. Yet, this idea that electric vehicles help to address climate change is not universally accepted by Americans. While about four in 10 U.S. adults think using EVs helps address climate change “a great deal” (12%) or “a fair amount” (27%), roughly six in 10 believe it helps “only a little” (35%) or “not at all” (26%). ###Embeddable### These findings are from a March 1-23 poll, which was the first time Gallup asked these questions about electric vehicles. Party Greatest Differentiator in Americans’ EV Use and Perceptions U.S. adults’ party identification is the greatest differentiator in both their openness to owning EVs and their perceptions of the environmental impact that the use of such vehicles would have. Current ownership of electric vehicles among partisans is 6% for Democrats, 4% for independents and 1% for Republicans. Democrats (22%) are also far more likely than both Republicans (1%) and independents (12%) to say they are seriously considering purchasing an EV. The majority of Democrats, 54%, say they may consider it in the future. Meanwhile, a substantial majority of Republicans, 71%, say they would not consider owning an electric vehicle. Other demographic differences in current and potential EV ownership, though influenced by party, are sizable. Americans aged 35-54 are more likely than those younger and older to already own or be seriously considering buying an electric vehicle. However, young adults 18-34 are most likely to say they may buy one in the future. Americans living in the Western U.S. and college graduates are more likely than their counterparts to report that they currently own an electric vehicle, are seriously considering the purchase or might in the future. Likewise, U.S. adults with annual household incomes of $100,000 and over are more likely than those in lower income groups to already own or say they may own an EV. This may be a function of the higher price tag on electric versus gas vehicles. ###Embeddable### Americans who worry a great deal about global warming or climate change are most open to owning an electric vehicle now or in the future, with 79% saying they currently own one (5%), are seriously considering it (16%) or would at some point (58%). Conversely, 77% of those who are not at all concerned about climate change say they would never own an EV. In addition to being more open to owning electric vehicles, Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say the use of EVs helps address climate change. Just over two-thirds of Democrats think electric vehicles help a great deal (22%) or a fair amount (46%). Meanwhile, 55% of Republicans say they do not help at all, and 32% believe they help only a little bit. Independents are closer to Republicans than Democrats in their views. ###Embeddable### Bottom Line While ownership of electric vehicles is on the rise in the U.S., the percentage of Americans who say they own one remains limited at 4%. Though they are often promoted as a key way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and address the effects of climate change, the public remains largely unconvinced that the use of EVs accomplishes this aim. The Biden administration has set a goal that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. The state of California has mandated that all new vehicle sales in the state by the year 2035 must be zero-emission vehicles, and major U.S. automakers are boosting EV production and, in some cases, phasing out gas-powered vehicles in the coming years. Given these changes, it is unclear to what extent Americans will be able to choose between electric and gas-powered vehicles in the next decade and beyond, but a majority of Americans now say they are at least open to buying an EV in the future. With four in 10 U.S. adults unwilling to even consider switching from a gas to an electric vehicle, the plans of Biden, California and auto manufacturers could be challenging to achieve. Previous Gallup polling has found that Americans aren’t always the best judge of their future behavior when it comes to technology. For example, as recently as 2000, a quarter of Americans thought they’d never own a smartphone . To stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on Twitter .

Survey Methods Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted March 1-23, 2023, with a random sample of 1,009 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting. Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 75% cellphone respondents and 25% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

Got it Jun 14, 2023, 08:45am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Doron Frenkel, founder and CEO of Driivz , a leading EV Charging and Energy Management Platform. getty Widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) across all populations and countries is essential to reaching global targets for CO2 reduction. We are making progress: EVs comprised 10% of total new car sales (paywall) in 2022, a 68% increase over 2021. However, to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, the International Energy Association projects that 60% of vehicles sold globally in 2030 will have to be EVs. As CEO of an EV charging and energy management platform, here are five actions, often interconnected and requiring collaboration across the complex EV ecosystem, that I believe are necessary to accelerate EV adoption and meet sustainability and climate goals. 1. Change consumer attitudes and awareness. Until a country crosses the tipping point for EV adoption, when EVs exceed 5% of new car sales and sales begin to take off, consumer awareness remains low. For example, in 2020, only 4% of U.S. drivers would “definitely” buy or lease an EV, while by 2022, 14% “definitely” would buy or lease, and 22% would “seriously consider” it. Globally, over half of 2022 consumers intending to buy a car in the next two years said they would choose an EV or hybrid vehicle, a 22% increase over 2020. But that’s still only half. To broaden acceptance across all demographics, the EV ecosystem should take action to increase awareness about EVs, their impact on the environment and the advantages of ownership, including lower operating and maintenance costs. EV incentives also need to be promoted. Almost half of Americans in 2022 were not aware of any incentives available for electric-only vehicles. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best Travel Insurance Companies By Amy Danise Editor Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans By Amy Danise Editor Even with heightened interest, consumers remain concerned about the persistent inhibitors to EV adoption: lack of charging infrastructure, range anxiety and cost. In these areas, actions will speak louder than words as the EV ecosystem works to address these very real issues and remove roadblocks. The charging ecosystem should be accessible and easy to use for the drivers. And manufacturers and charging network operators can provide more consumer education, such as short videos that explain how and where to charge. 2. Rapidly expand EV charging infrastructure. EV charging is a chicken-and-egg issue that has a continuing impact on EV adoption. Drivers who don’t have access to residential driveway charging will not adopt EVs unless they are confident that at-work, destination, on-street, highway and other public charging will be readily available. These drivers represent a significant segment of future EV owners, so their concerns need to be addressed today. Infrastructure builders, on the other hand, are being asked to make capital investments now in a business that won't generate significant profits until 2030 or thereabouts. In the near term, government subsidies and tax incentives are helping to bridge the gap as network owners monetize their businesses. Much needed are changes in local permitting and grid access, both of which are typically long and complex processes for EV charging operators. Nonetheless, analysts at Bain & Company assert that “EV charging infrastructure and services critical to the adoption of [EVs] are a huge and strategic new business opportunity,” including smart energy management-based services like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-home (V2H). To be profitable, EV charging operators must deliver an excellent customer experience by maximizing charger availability and stability, ensuring ease of use, providing smart user tools and supporting roaming for payments. 3. Transform EVs from a grid liability to a grid asset. Power utilities need to take action now to upgrade the grid for increased demand from millions of EVs as they work to increase supplies of renewable energy. This includes providing thousands or millions of standardized, reliable, readily available grid connections for EV charging operators to enable infrastructure build-out and increase consumer confidence in the availability of EV charging. In addition to grid upgrades, utilities can moderate the impact of demand increases by implementing smart charging V2G technology , where the millions of EVs serve as “batteries on wheels.” In this scenario, charge point operators may decide when to charge the vehicles, when to stop charging and when to store energy and feed it back to the grid. Leaders in utilities also need to establish policies and invest in technologies that will enable smart energy management for load balancing and to avoid peak demand increases. These include variable rate structures based on time of use to modify consumer charging behavior, demand response programs for large EV charging users like fleets and elimination of demand charges that penalize EV charging operators. 4. Ramp up EV production and reduce prices. As consumer awareness and market conditioning work to increase demand, automakers are ramping up production—although this is not a rapid process. It requires new plants and total retooling of production. However, 37 automakers globally are investing $1.2 trillion in EVs and batteries through 2030 to meet production targets of 54 million EVs in 2030 . For 2023, new mid-market models will open EV driving to a wider range of buyers, particularly when under $40,000 prices are combined with government-provided incentives to make these models truly affordable. Leaders in the industry can contribute to the process of electrification of transportation by forming partnerships between different parties in the EV ecosystem. For example, for automakers, EV charging providers and power utilities to generate buzz, educate and excite consumers about the boundless potential which could be realized from zero-emissions transportation. 5. Continue government incentives and EV-friendly regulations. Between now and 2030, when the EV industry approaches financial viability, technological maturity and broader consumer acceptance, leaders in government need to continue incentives and subsidies that drive supply and demand of vehicles and charging infrastructure. Although incentives have been effective in Norway and the U.K. in accelerating EV adoption, these countries, along with Germany, are phasing out incentives, creating concern that rising inflation and production costs will slow adoption going forward. Yet, if we take Norway as an example, there is a point where EVs become just a vehicle and the only choice for the public, even without incentives. Looking Ahead Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is imperative for the health of the planet, and EVs can play a critical role in making that happen. However, current projections for EV adoption indicate that we are not on track to meet road transportation-related CO2 reduction targets. As industry leaders, we need to move faster by taking action on all fronts so more consumers will purchase EVs sooner.

            Highlights New study examines consumer and dealer perspectives on EV sales, service and maintenance. Consumer EV consideration is growing, but EV affordability continues to be the top sales barrier. Dealers feel unprepared for the electric future – look to OEMs for guidance. ATLANTA, June 27, 2023 – Despite growing interest, a gap exists between consumer enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs) and their actual purchasing decisions, according to new research released today by Cox Automotive. The 2023 Path to EV Adoption: Consumer and Dealer Perspectives study also reveals a lack of EV readiness among U.S. automotive dealers regarding sales and service. As EV inventories continue to climb, dealers must bridge this gap. “Education for both consumers and dealers remains a critical factor in driving widespread confidence and adoption of electric vehicles,” said Kayla Reynolds, Manager of Research & Market Intelligence, Cox Automotive Mobility. “For dealers specifically, preparation is paramount, and our findings emphasize the urgency of equipping dealers with EV sales and servicing capabilities to meet the needs and demands of EV buyers.” The Cox Automotive study, available for download , surveyed 1,024 consumers and 152 dealers, comparing data points from electric vehicle research conducted by the company over the last several years. Key Takeaways: 2023 Cox Automotive Path to EV Adoption: Consumer and Dealer Perspectives Study EV Consideration Grows Rapidly, Sales More Slowly Cox Automotive is forecasting that 1 million new EVs will be sold in the U.S. in 2023, a record and more than twice the volume sold in 2021. The industry’s sales growth has been powered not only by Tesla’s rapid expansion, but also a flow of new products into the market – 33 new EVs are being launched in 2023 alone, according to estimates from Kelley Blue Book, a Cox Automotive company. More than 50 additional new or updated EVs will be launched in 2024. According to Cox Automotive research, 51% of consumers are now considering either a new or used EV, up from 38% in 2021. Still, while interest in EVs rapidly increases, the gap between consideration and sales remains wide. EVs will account for less than 8% of total new-vehicle sales in 2023. On the used side, EV share of the total market remains approximately 1%. In many parts of the country, new EV inventory levels are increasing, as products arrive more quickly than consumers buy. In June, EV days of supply – a measure of inventory levels in the U.S. – was approaching 100 days, nearly twice the industry-wide average. As the Cox Automotive study shows, EV consideration is well ahead of sales. Affordability continues to the top obstacle for EV buyers, with 43% of intenders noting EVs are too expensive, up slightly from the level in 2021. Other barriers, however, are falling. In 2021, 40% of intenders cited a lack of charging stations as a top roadblock. That number has fallen to 32%. Future EV Readiness Gap There is a significant gap in readiness between consumers and dealers in terms of embracing electric vehicles. According to the survey, 53% of consumers feel EVs are the future and will largely replace gas engines over time, compared to only 31% of dealers. Nearly half (45%) of dealers surveyed feel that EVs still need to prove themselves in the marketplace. While consumer adoption of EVs is expected to soar as more models hit the market, dealerships are not prepared regarding sales and service capabilities, raising concerns about the overall customer experience and satisfaction. According to the survey, 82% of dealers are required by their OEM to make an EV investment. This should help dealers build the infrastructure needed to support EV growth. OEM Support Needed Despite concerns, dealers see electric vehicles as important to the growth of their dealerships, both in selling (55%) and servicing (57%) EVs. However, the study reveals that dealerships need more support and guidance from automakers, which they view as their preferred source of EV information. Dealers are thirsty for comprehensive and up-to-date information to ensure they become the go-to resource for customers, specifically in areas of charging infrastructure and battery technology. According to the study, areas where dealers need to learn more about EVs include the battery lifecycle, battery health and overall servicing of an electric vehicle. According to the survey, this is consistent with EV owners, who also showed an interest in learning more about battery health. Crucial Need for Equipping Dealerships While the likelihood of an EV buyer deciding to purchase before visiting a dealership is high, current EV owners still prefer dealerships for servicing and maintenance. Unfortunately, more than half of the dealerships surveyed are not fully prepared to handle the specific needs of EVs. Feedback collected from dealers who took the survey noted more infrastructure for DC fast chargers and more technicians dedicated to BEVs are needed. This preparation will be essential, as among dealers who do not currently sell EVs, 55% are expecting to begin in the next year and 34% within the next six months, according to the study.

The current paper aims to identify the key determinants affecting the consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on private passenger cars. Toward this purpose, a systematic review of recent international literature is conducted in order to identify motivators and barriers, which are then categorized following the PESTLE (Political–Economic–Social–Technological–Legal–Environmental) approach. Based on the review results, main policy implications and recommendations are discussed. A main conclusion is that the recent literature highlights a wide array of determinants, without converging as to which ones are the most influential regarding EV adoption by consumers. Another conclusion is that the environmental aspects are less important for consumers than anticipated, despite the concerns about climate change and renewable energy transition. Keywords: electric vehicles ; EV adoption ; consumer ; determinants ; factors ; PESTLE ; literature review 1. Introduction The reliance of transport in fossil fuels is higher than any other end-use sector. According to the most recent available data for 2022, the transport sector’s share of CO 2 emissions has reached approximately 37%, presenting an increasing trend after lifting mobility restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic [ 1 ]. Road transport is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted by transport. In Europe, for example, road transport GHG emissions correspond to more than 70% of total domestic and international transport GHG emissions [ 2 ]. In addition, road transport is responsible for pollutant emissions, such as NOx and particulate matter, as well as for unacceptable noise levels. The need to reduce the negative external impacts from road transport is even more crucial in the urban context, with cities being responsible for consuming 78% of energy resources and producing more than 60% of GHG emissions globally [ 3 ]. Approximately 68% of the world’s population is expected to reside in cities by 2050 [ 4 ]. Taking the above into account, the shift to carbon-neutral, environmentally friendly and overall sustainable transport for all is timelier than ever. The promotion of electromobility (e-mobility) is considered one of the main policies to achieve sustainable road transport [ 5 ]. A main advantage of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engine (ICE) refers to energy efficiency. The reduction in energy use of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) compared to an ICE vehicle is estimated to exceed 75% [ 6 ]. On the other hand, the lifecycle performance of electric vehicles regarding GHG emissions depends mainly on the energy mix to produce electricity and the developments in battery manufacturing and recycling technologies [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]. Electric vehicles (EVs) also have a strong potential for reducing pollutant emissions, including noise pollution [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]. Following the promotion policies and the industrial and technological advancements in the field of electromobility, the market of electric vehicles has been rapidly growing. In 2021, one out of ten car sales globally were electric, corresponding to a four-fold rise compared to 2019 and leading to a total number of 16.5 million electric cars worldwide [ 13 ]. However, the share of electric vehicles to the total number of circulating cars in the world is still relatively small, while great differences are observed in the adoption of electromobility between different regions and countries [ 14 ]. For example, studies argue that some countries, such as the Scandinavian countries and northern Europe, are pioneers in electromobility advancements, and others, such as China, are investing in smaller vehicles and lower manufacturing costs to bridge the price gap between electric and conventional vehicles, while many countries are still lagging behind in electric car adoption [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. In the above context, the scope of the current paper is to contribute to the international research on the main determinants that affect the adoption of electric passenger cars by consumers (end-users) in different geographic areas of the world. These determinants are characterized either as motivators, i.e., aspects that positively affect end-users into selecting an electric vehicle over a conventional one, or as barriers, i.e., aspects that hinder the selection of electric vehicles by end-users. Moreover, the current research brings forward determinants that are perceived in a different way by different samples of end-users in different geographical areas, leading sometimes to contradictory results. The comprehensive and comparative presentation of these determinants can enhance the understanding of policymakers, private bodies and citizens regarding the benefits and drawbacks of electromobility. This understanding will enhance the capacity to develop appropriate policies that will improve the efficiency of the market by addressing the real needs and expectations of consumers. A main research objective of the current study is the identification of the main determinants of EV adoption by consumers and their comparative analysis in terms of the importance attributed by consumers in the international literature. Moreover, the study attempts to assess the importance of the current climate crisis as a determinant of consumers’ EV adoption in comparison to other determinants, such as personal costs, range anxiety and charging infrastructure availability. The vast majority of recent research papers in the field of EV adoption refer to the assessment of the determinants that affect consumers’ choices and/or perceptions. There are also few papers that review the international literature on EV adoption determinants [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ]. In particular, Singh et al. [ 18 ] categorized the factors influencing consumers’ intention to adopt an EV into four main categories (demographic, situational, contextual, psychological), in order to examine their influence on consumers’ intention to adopt an EV. Kumar and Alok [ 19 ] studied the mechanisms of EV adoption, by categorizing the main mediators and moderators into five main categories (technical and product features, government policy, sociodemographic factors, social influence, consumer behavior). Stockkamp et al. [ 20 ] adopted the above-mentioned categorization in order to study the factors associated with EV adoption by consumers. Austmann [ 21 ] examined the influence of relevant determinants on the EV market. The added value of the current paper on the existing literature stems from the collection and comprehensive analysis of the most recent, highly influential research papers and the categorization of the determinants of EV consumer adoption based on the PESTLE (Political–Economic–Social/Sociodemographic–Technological/Technical–Legal-Environmental) analysis [ 22 ]. This categorization allows for the systematic review and the comparative analysis among broader categories of determinants. More specifically, the current paper is based on the systematic review of recent international literature in order to identify the aspects that affect the adoption of electric passenger cars by end-users and to organize them into main determinants, following the PESTLE analysis. After the Introduction, the terms “electric vehicle” and “electromobility” are defined, and the categories of electric vehicles are briefly presented. Next, the methodology of the current research is described, followed by the organized presentation of results. The results include the brief presentation of the bibliographic metrics and the publication details, methodological approach and location of the study area of each of the examined papers. They also include the comprehensive analysis of the motivators and barriers that derive from these papers, as key determinants of EV adoption. In the final part of the paper, the identified determinants related to EV adoption are summarized, and the main results are discussed, while conclusions, managerial and policy implications and prospects for future research are also included. 2. Definitions and Categorization of Electric Vehicles Prior to the in-depth examination of the determinants affecting the adoption of electric passenger cars, it is important to provide a definition of the corresponding terms. According to the European Union Science Hub [ 23 ], electromobility “refers to clean and efficient transport, using electric vehicles, powered either by batteries or by hydrogen fuel cells”. According to the EU Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure [ 24 ], an electric vehicle refers to “a motor vehicle equipped with a powertrain containing at least one non-peripheral electric machine as energy converter with an electric rechargeable energy storage system, which can be recharged externally”. Currently, there are four main categories of electric vehicles that are electrically chargeable [ 25 , 26 , 27 ]: a. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), fully powered by an electric motor using on-board battery that can be charged through the electric grid; b. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), powered by a battery-powered electric motor that can be charged through the grid and which is supported by an internal combustion engine; c. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), powered by an electric motor using fuel cell instead of battery or in combination with a battery or a supercapacitor; d. Range extender electric vehicles (REEV), having an on-board liquid fuel converter to produce electrical energy and to extend the mileage of the vehicle; Furthermore, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are not electrically chargeable but are powered by an internal combustion engine and an electric motor that uses energy from a battery that is recharged through the vehicle’s braking system. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Categorization of the Key Determinants In order to systematically analyze the aspects that affect the adoption of electric vehicles, an approach for the categorization of key determinants is proposed, based on the implementation of PESTLE analysis. This approach is suggested as an outcome from the synthetic overview of other literature reviews, analyses of case studies and consultant reports. More specifically, Kumar and Alok [ 19 ] categorized the main factors associated with the adoption of electric vehicles by consumers into: (a) technical and product features (ownership costs, vehicle performance, product perception, environmental benefits); (b) government policy (charging infrastructure, incentives); (c) sociodemographic factors (gender, age, income, education, living and family conditions); (d) social influence; (e) consumer behavior (environmental awareness, innovativeness, emotions and consumer intention). Stockkamp et al. [ 20 ] adopted this categorization. The International Transport Forum (ITF) argues that the main factors for the deployment of “clean” vehicles refer to the categories of policy (to support innovation and enhance awareness) and technology (to reduce cost and improve productivity) [ 28 ]. Schlosser et al. [ 15 ] identified, as main factors for the customer readiness to adopt electric vehicles, the economic factors (namely personal costs), the technical factors (such as the availability of charging points), the social and personal perceptions and the predominant socio-economic conditions. Ruoso and Ribeiro [ 29 ] identified the categories: (a) social; (b) environmental; (c) economic; (d) technical; and (e) political, which are weighted differently regarding the adoption of electromobility by each of the examined stakeholder groups (automotive industry, energy distributors, researchers and academics, etc.). Based on the above findings and in order to formulate a categorization that will be widely accepted by the international research community, the categorization used in the current research comprises the following categories of key determinants: political; economic; social/sociodemographic; technological/technical; legal; and environmental. 3.2. Methodological Approach Over the last decade, a significant number of research papers have been published related to the adoption of electromobility from the perspective of policymakers, manufacturers and commercial organizations and, mostly, of end-users. In the last category, the available research is focusing on either the actual selection of electric vehicles from consumers or their intention to select these vehicles in hypothetical situations. There are three main considerations when setting up the current paper’s literature review approach: (i) The review aims at identifying the key determinants affecting the adoption of private, passenger electric vehicles by end-users, as the choice of an electric vehicle is determined by different aspects according to the use of the vehicle as private or shared passenger car, public transport, light duty van, etc. (ii) The available number of papers in the literature is high enough to include all the key determinants but is manageable to allow for a thorough analysis. (iii) The period of analysis covers the last 3 years, based on the fact that the market share of electric vehicles has grown four times in the period 2019–2021, with increasing trends thus far in 2022 [ 13 ], and on the assumption that this is directly related to a shift in end-users’ choice over this period. In the above context, the main features of the methodological approach of the literature review are described below: “Scopus” database was used as the main source for the primary extraction of research papers. The use of appropriate combinations of terms (“electric” AND “vehicles” AND “adoption”) was selected to identify relevant papers. The search led to a total of 3537 documents. The period of publication was defined between 2020 and 2022. The last update was conducted on 4 October 2022. From the above documents, the ones written in the English language were selected, and then, the ones that are articles published in scientific journals were chosen. Using the above filters, a total of 989 documents were extracted. The research domain that was selected refers to the broader scientific fields of “Engineering, Social Sciences, Energy and Environmental Science”, while the terms “electric vehicle(s)” or “EV(s)” were selected as keywords to exclude any remaining irrelevant documentation. Using the above filters, a total of 350 documents were extracted. Within these documents, only peer-reviewed articles from Q1 journals, according to Scimago list of 2022, were selected manually, leading to a total of 303 documents. The selection of articles published only in Q1 journals was used to maximize the internal validity of the review, given that the content of the articles published in such journals is widely considered to be reliable and valid. A first review of the documents, based on title and abstract screening, was conducted to exclude those that do not refer to private cars, i.e., public transport, shared vehicles, micromobility, freight and commercial vehicles, etc. After this process, a total of 73 documents was selected for further analysis. Based on access rights of these documents, a total of 61 documents was finally selected for further analysis. The workflow of the literature review methodology, incorporating searching criteria and filters, is shown in Figure 1 . The above database of articles was analyzed in view of: The analysis of the number of documents per year by source and by country/territory, as well as the share of documents by subject area, according to the classification of the “Scopus” database and manual configuration. The brief description of the type of research methods adopted and presented by each document to derive the determinants of EV adoption. The identification of the main determinants affecting electric vehicle adoption and the discussion of common and contradictory results from the international literature. The results of the analysis are presented in the following section. 4. Results 4.1. Distribution of Papers by Leading Journal, Country and Subject Area Figure 2 , Figure 3 and Figure 4 refer to all articles that were published in scientific journals in the period 2020–2022 and refer to the adoption of any type of electric vehicle (i.e., 989 documents), regardless of the research domain of the article or the ranking and access rights of the journal. The purpose of this representation is to give a cumulative overview and to present the general trends during the last 3 years. On the other hand, Figure 5 , Figure 6 and Figure 7 refer to the documents selected for further analysis in the current study by applying the appropriate filters and manual selection processes, as presented in Section 3.2 (i.e., 61 documents). Figure 2 presents the number of documents in the initial list of papers (i.e., 989 documents) per year and by source (leading sources only). “Energies” was found in the first place regarding the number of publications, followed by “Transportation Research Part D”, “Transport and Environment”, “Sustainability Switzerland”, “Applied Energy” and “Energy policy”. Regarding the initial list of papers (i.e., 989 documents), the number of documents by country/territory (leading countries/territories only), for the years 2020–2022, is shown in Figure 3 . United States was found in first place, with China, India, United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Germany, South Korea, Australia and Spain following. The share of papers in the initial list of papers (i.e., 989 documents) by subject area, for the years 2020–2022, is shown in Figure 4 . The highest share corresponds to “Engineering”, while “Energy”, “Environmental science”, “Social sciences”, “Computer science”, “Business, management and accounting”, “Mathematics”, “Decision sciences”, “Material science” and “Economics, econometrics and finance” follow, with the rest of the articles belonging to other subject areas.

In Figure 6 , the number of analyzed documents (i.e., 61 documents) by country/ territory (leading countries/territories only), for the years 2020–2022 is shown. China was found in first place, with India, USA, UK, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, France and South Korea following. The share of analyzed papers (i.e., 61 documents) by subject area, for the years 2020–2022, is shown in Figure 7 . The higher share corresponds to “Environmental science”, while “Energy”, “Social sciences” and “Engineering” follow. 4.2. Research Methods and Study Areas The research method adopted by each of the analyzed studies, along with the study area (country, region, city(ies) or area) in each case, are shown in Table 1 . A variety of qualitative and quantitative methods are applied, either separately or in combination, to obtain the actual adoption or the intention to adopt EVs. Quantitative methods are applied in the majority of the papers, with the questionnaire survey being predominant. Τhe study areas are located in Europe, Asia, America and Oceania. Certain documents do not refer to a specific area, while others refer to more than one area, as shown in Table 1 . 4.3. Key Determinants affecting the Adoption of Electric Vehicles According to the PESTLE approach, the key determinants in the analysis are categorized as: (i) political; (ii) economic; (iii) social/sociodemographic; (iv) technological/technical; (v) legal; and (vi) environmental. For each category, the key determinants (either barriers or motivators) that affect the adoption of electric vehicles in different cases and geographic areas are presented. 4.3.1. Political Determinants Li et al. [ 76 ] concluded that consistency, coherence, and credibility of policy mix play a significant role in the intention to acquire electric vehicles (EVs) in China. Similarly, the analysis of Goel et al. [ 59 ] highlights that unclear policies related with the replacement of fossil fuel cars with Evs, through financial incentives, awareness campaigns, etc., constitute a significant barrier toward EV adoption in India. Government incentives also seem to affect the consumers’ intention to adopt an EV in Taiwan [ 54 ]. Financial and non-financial incentives can play a significant role toward plug-in EV adoption by American consumers according to [ 73 ], while Hsu and Fingerman [ 74 ] state that such incentives should be expanded to “undeserved communities” in order to increase EV adoption in California, USA. An interesting finding, regarding two different studies in India, is that financial and non-financial incentives are not considered crucial for EV adoption according to [ 47 ], while they arise as important determinants in the study of Chhikara et al. [ 55 ]. Financial support to consumers by governments is highlighted as an important incentive in various case studies [ 34 , 43 , 55 , 67 , 89 ]. Financial incentives can play an important role toward EV adoption in Virginia, USA [ 67 ], India [ 34 ], Spain [ 89 ] and China [ 43 ]. Taxation policies including reduction in taxes for those who purchase an EV seem to be a crucial determinant for the adoption of EVs in Brazil [ 29 ] and Ireland [ 48 ]. Tax reduction policies have a stronger positive impact on the adoption of EVs by consumers compared to purchase subsidies according to [ 70 ]. On the other hand, government policy including subsidies for the purchase of an EV and electricity subsidies related to the operational cost of an EV arise as important determinants related to the adoption of EVs [ 30 , 31 ]. Purchase subsidies are regarded as a determinant of high importance in France, Germany and Norway, according to Künle and Minke [ 37 ]. According to Kong et al. [ 80 ], purchase subsidies are a determining aspect for the willingness of Chinese consumers to acquire an electric vehicle. Research focusing on specific age groups, such as the research of Sahoo et al. [ 39 ] on millennials in India, highlights that psychological motives regarding the perception toward EV adoption are affected by appropriate governmental policies (such as financial incentivization). According to Ogunkunbi et al. [ 44 ], the study of whom refers to 15 European countries, financial subsidies and tax reduction are not positively associated with BEV adoption. The authors of the specific study claim that the previous studies led to different results because the examined policies covered all types of EVs, with end-users preferring other types of EVs (e.g., PHEV) rather than BEV, due to the “lower purchase price, longer range and shorter refueling time”. Regarding other end-user incentivization policies, the research of Stauch [ 64 ] concludes that German consumers are more willing to purchase an EV when the acquisition is bundled with a solar energy system, independently of a discount in the total cost, suggesting that relevant policies could increase electric vehicle adoption in general. According to Plananska and Gamma [ 49 ], the incorporation of EV insurance, battery assistance and a green electricity certificate can increase the adoption of electric vehicles by Swiss consumers. According to the same study, policies oriented to bundling EV and charging services can determine the adoption of EVs by Swiss consumers, while financial subsidies and investment in charging infrastructure are also identified as important determinants. Li et al. and Li et al. [ 78 , 88 ] found for China that policies such as license restriction rescission, free parking or free charging are more effective than purchase policies for certain consumers, especially younger ones, in combination with information provision and market-oriented incentives, such as personal carbon trading scheme and tradable driving credits. Ma and Fan [ 75 ] suggested that the reduction in electricity rate is important to increase BEV attractiveness in China. As mentioned in the above, another main policy measure that can affect EV adoption combined with financial incentivization refers to information and awareness campaigns [ 42 , 56 , 75 , 79 ]. Information campaigns and test-driving possibilities emerge as important determinants in various studies [ 35 , 46 , 48 , 76 ], as the familiarity of consumers with EVs and their benefits is linked to the probability of purchasing an EV. Zhang et al. [ 50 ] concluded that the perceived value of an EV and the trust in an EV by Chinese consumers are affected by the level of the information on environmental impact, operation and maintenance costs, and vehicle attributes, such as speed, user-friendliness, energy efficiency, shortened driving time and longer range due to technological advancement. The study proposes measures such as exhibitions, conferences, EV rental and sharing programs, test-driving, etc. The level of consumer awareness, concerning advantages and financial subsidies, significantly affects the likelihood of purchasing an EV, and in particular a BEV in New Zealand, according to Broadbent et al. [ 53 ], with the authors stressing the importance of media for the dissemination of relevant information. Lashari et al. [ 62 ] claimed that the awareness of Korean consumers regarding EVs’ environmental and economic benefits, as well as regarding the governmental measures linked to existing environmental policies and to the reduction of the EVs’ operational cost, constitute determining factors toward EV adoption. Lashari et al. [ 62 ] also highlight the significance of awareness campaigns and test-driving incentives in order to inform consumers on EV advantages related to, e.g., environment, economy, safety, easiness to drive and make them familiar with this new technology, in combination with sufficient infrastructure development. Haustein et al. [ 71 ] argued that according to their research, information campaigns can significantly affect BEV adoption in Sweden, but not in Denmark. The significance of subsidy policies in India, along with the awareness of consumers concerning the existence of such policies, are highlighted in [ 40 ], while the importance of tax allocation and subsidy policies, as well as information campaigns related to EV advantages in the USA, is highlighted in [ 56 ]. Many research papers, such as [ 41 , 49 , 58 , 62 , 81 ], concluded that investment on public charging infrastructure, combined with subsidization and awareness, is also a determinant toward increasing EV adoption. The investment in more charging infrastructure facilities and the technological advancement related to, e.g., increased battery capacity can also contribute to increasing EV adoption in Korea, as mentioned in [ 62 ]. Geronikolos and Potoglou [ 63 ] concluded that investment in charging infrastructure, together with incentives related to EVs purchase cost, tax reduction or exemption, constitute determinants for the adoption of EVs in Greece. Apart from financial incentives, information campaigns focusing on EV advantages, especially the environmental benefits, and investment policies in public charging infrastructure, can contribute to a broader BEV adoption, according to [ 81 ]. The analysis executed in [ 58 ] also leads to the conclusion that investment in public charging infrastructure and financial subsidies are policies of high importance, along with the consumers’ awareness on EVs on behalf of governments and the automobile industry. The effect of public charging infrastructure investments and vehicle subsidies for the acquisition of EVs in California is investigated in [ 41 ], documenting that both policies are of high importance within the framework of EV adoption. Ma and Fan [ 75 ] stress the significance of information campaigns, as well as of the reduction in electricity rate, in order to increase EV sales. The same study led to the conclusion that governmental subsidies to operators for the construction of EV charging infrastructure and the policy of limiting the ceiling of the charging service fee in China are not so effective. Zhuge et al. [ 82 ] concluded that the policy of the Chinese government related to restrictions on the number of permits per household affects the purchase of EVs, especially of PHEVs. In particular, an increase in the number of permits is allegedly associated with an increase in the purchase of EVs. 4.3.2. Economic Determinants The high acquisition cost, mainly related to the high cost of the battery, appears as the most important economic barrier toward EV adoption in various studies in Brazil, Ireland and India [ 29 , 34 , 40 , 42 , 47 , 48 ]. The cost for EV acquisition of an EV comprises one of the important barriers in studies referring to China [ 68 ], UK [ 65 ] and the Nordic region [ 84 ], while it is a key determinant for the adoption of EVs in Korea, especially compared to the cost of the consumer’s previous fossil fuel vehicle [ 60 ]. Contradictory results regarding the importance of acquisition costs for EV adoption in India derive from the studies of [ 61 ] and Goel et al. [ 59 ]. Overall, electric vehicles are characterized by lower maintenance cost, affecting profitability of the aftermarket, and lower operation cost compared to conventional cars [ 29 , 30 , 90 ]. Maintenance costs, mainly linked to battery replacement, are an important aspect for EV adoption in India [ 59 ]. Both acquisition and maintenance costs seem to affect the consumers’ intention to adopt an EV in Taiwan [ 54 ], while acquisition and operation costs constitute important determinants for the adoption of EVs in Virginia, USA [ 67 ]. The perception of an EV as an overall economically efficient vehicle constitutes a determining aspect for EV adoption in Korea [ 62 ]. However, the comparison of the operation cost between plug-in electric and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) greatly depends on electricity tariffs and petrol prices, with the analysis of Ruoso and Ribeiro [ 29 ] indicating that the cost of electricity for charging and high taxation, due to import and production costs, are also important barriers toward EV adoption in Brazil. An interesting perspective is given by Xia et al. [ 43 ], who applied the DOI theory to conclude that the risk of the vehicle price reduction (the vehicle someone purchases today will be discounted in the future) can negatively affect Chinese consumers toward EV adoption. 4.3.3. Social and Sociodemographic Determinants Regarding social trends, the possession of an electric vehicle is presently considered a status symbol, as indicated by Kester et al. [ 91 ] (as mentioned in [ 29 ]). Xia et al. [ 43 ] confirmed this trend for consumers in Wuhan, China. Another interesting approach related to EV adoption in China was introduced by Li et al. [ 32 ], who argued that the selection of an electric vehicle by an end-user can be affected by inter-dependent, self-image motives. In particular, certain people may decide to purchase an EV in order to be regarded by others or because they regard themselves as “environmentalists”, others may opt for an EV in order to be “innovation adopters”, and others in order to feel or be shown as “ethical consumers” within the framework of their ethical commitment to society to adopt socially desired behaviors. In the same context, Haustein et al. [ 71 ] emphasized that the perceived status, lifestyle, social norm, as well as the excitement linked to BEV ownership, are significant motivators in Denmark and Sweden. Social reputation seems to influence the intention toward EV adoption in Spain, according to Higueras-Castillo et al. [ 89 ]. Contrary to the above, social status and subjective norms related to EVs are not found to be determining for EV adoption in India [ 47 , 66 ] and Malaysia [ 79 ], while the lack of trust in electric vehicles arises as an important barrier in India [ 59 , 61 ] and Korea [ 62 ]. Apart from general social trends, the analysis of Goel et al., 2021 [ 59 ], shows that the family environment significantly affects decisions on the purchase of EVs in India. Similarly, Dutta and Hwang [ 54 ] concluded in their study that “peer pressure” and mass media decisively affect consumers’ intention to adopt an EV in Taiwan. An interesting finding from the research of Guerra and Daziano [ 86 ] is that the willingness to purchase an electric vehicle decreases with the number of family members in a household, in a study in Philadelphia, USA. The study of Sheng et al. [ 45 ] in New Zealand shows the effect of EV acquisition at neighborhood level, i.e., early EV adoption by a member of a neighborhood may promote EV purchase by other neighbors. In addition to the influence of the social environment, personal behavioral characteristics, such as openness to new experiences and self-esteem, also affect the consumers’ perception regarding electric vehicles in China [ 68 , 76 ]. The research of Irfan and Ahmad [ 57 ] argues that openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness positively affect EV adoption, while neuroticism generates a negative influence concerning EV adoption in India. Consumer behaviors related to information on EV benefits and to the risks associated with new technology adoption have a determining role according to Singh and Singh [ 36 ]. In addition, psychological barriers related with the anxiety for the availability of charging infrastructure during a long trip seem to be important determinants for EV adoption in India, according to Murugan and Marisamynathan [ 40 ]. In the same direction, based on the investigation of the relationship between key spatio-temporal aspects and consumers’ intention to purchase an electric vehicle in Auckland, New Zealand, Sheng et al. [ 45 ] concluded that the availability of public charging infrastructure in neighboring areas can positively affect the intention to adopt EVs. Regarding socio-demographics, men, younger people and people with a higher education level are more likely to purchase an EV in India according to a survey conducted by Ali and Naushad [ 47 ]. The attractiveness for male and younger consumers is verified for Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden by Chen et al. [ 83 ], despite the fact that, according to previous studies [ 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 ], the older consumers are usually the ones who can actually afford to purchase an EV in these countries. The same study states that consumers with more than one vehicle and long-distance commuters were less likely to acquire an EV, while consumers who have tried to drive an EV are more likely to acquire one. Another survey by Ju and Hun Kim [ 33 ] focused on the influence of perceived EV characteristics (comfort, functionality, availability, price conformity, risk, environmental impact and innovation resistance) on Korean and American drivers between the ages of 24 and 40 (millennials), highlighting the need to study the impact on millennials separately for each country in order to formulate appropriate policies for the promotion of electromobility. According to Xue et al. [ 70 ], consumers with higher income are more likely to purchase an EV. In addition to higher income, Wee et al. [ 85 ] highlighted that consumers of a higher level of education are more likely to purchase an EV, according to their study in Hawaii, USA. In addition to higher income, the study of Brückmann et al. [ 72 ] shows that having more than one car in the household, owning detached dwellings, being attracted to new technologies and being accustomed to carsharing favor the selection of a BEV in Switzerland. Mukherjee and Ryan [ 87 ] claim that Irish consumers with higher education and income, homeowners, medium- and long-distance commuters (due to long-term cost savings related to BEV) and older than 34 years are more likely to become early BEV adopters. 4.3.4. Technological/Technical Determinants According to various studies worldwide, the insufficiency of charging infrastructure seems to be one of the most important barriers for the consumer adoption of EVs [ 29 , 31 , 34 , 52 , 60 , 70 , 78 ]. Charging infrastructure availability is of high importance for EV adoption in China, as stated in [ 78 ]. The density of public charging infrastructure is highlighted as an important factor for BEV adoption in Norway [ 51 ] and China [ 75 ], while it is stressed that this factor does not significantly affect PHEV adoption in China [ 75 ]. Haustein et al. [ 71 ] concluded that fast charging infrastructure is a significant factor for EV adoption for consumers in Denmark, but not in Sweden. Charging infrastructure availability emerges as the most important factor for EV adoption in India [ 40 , 42 ], while according to the same studies, speed, range, comfort, design and battery technology are also important to Indian consumers. In contradiction to the above, another study in India argues that charging infrastructure is not a determinant of EV adoption in India [ 47 ]. Künle and Minke [ 37 ] highlight the so-called “chicken–egg paradox” regarding the relation between the availability of charging infrastructure and the number of circulating plug-in electric vehicles, concluding that charging infrastructure is certainly required for a higher EV adoption, but technology itself cannot be regarded as the most decisive factor for EV adoption. In this context, White et al. [ 38 ] concluded that the density of public charging stations is an important factor as regards the consumer intention to adopt an EV in USA. According to Illmann and Kluge [ 77 ], the availability of public charging infrastructure affects EV adoption in Germany, but charging time is an even more important determinant for EV adoption. Charging time constitutes an important determinant for the adoption of EVs in Virginia, USA, according to Jia and Chen [ 67 ], while battery range and charging infrastructure availability are important to those who already own an EV. On the other hand, charging time (rapid or normal charging) does not influence the intention of Chinese consumers to purchase BEVs according to Li et al., 2020c [ 88 ], due to the fact that most consumers remain home for a period of full charge (about 6–8 h). In the same study, battery warranty and vehicle’s depreciation rate comprise important factors for BEV adoption, given the residual value of a BEV, which is allegedly higher than that of an ICE vehicle. The lack of adequately skilled staff in charging stations and service centers is another barrier regarding the adoption of EVs in India, according to the studies of Ramesan et al. [ 31 ] and Goel et al. [ 59 ]. Technological advancement in the field of EVs seems to affect the intention to adopt and the actual adoption of EVs in many countries, such as Brazil [ 29 ] and India [ 31 ]. Smart and automated functions positively affect consumers’ choice, according to Ullah et al. [ 66 , 69 ]. A number of studies highlight a combination of the above factors as determinants of EV adoption. For instance, the selection of EVs by end-users in India is determined by vehicle performance [ 61 , 66 ] and battery range. Similarly, EV performance and battery range constitute important factors for EV adoption in the UK [ 65 ]. Vehicle performance and charging infrastructure availability seem to affect the consumers’ perspective in Taiwan [ 54 ]. Chen et al. [ 83 ] concluded that charging time and vehicle-to-grid capability are important factors for EV adoption in the Nordic region, while battery life and public charging availability arise as much more important factors for conventional car owners than for EV owners. According to the same study, driving range, speed, acceleration, design and style do not really affect the intention of consumers to adopt EVs, while fuel economy, ease of operation, and technological reliability are important for EV adoption. Driving range and charging infrastructure availability are also highlighted as important for consumers in the Nordic region, according to Noel et al. [ 84 ]. The proximity of charging stations and the charging time constitute important factors for EV adoption in Korea, according to Jang and Choi [ 60 ]. Range anxiety (especially for long-distance commuters), availability of public charging infrastructure and charging time are considered as main determinants in Hawaii, USA [ 85 ] and Spain [ 89 ]. Guerra and Daziano [ 86 ] concluded that consumers in Philadelphia, USA, are willing to pay for longer EV driving range, shorter charging time and lower operation cost. 4.3.5. Legal Determinants The legal factor is not thoroughly addressed by recent literature, comprising isolated remarks and proposals referring to incentives for underprivileged citizens, the establishment of obligations to build new charging infrastructure and the control of car ownership and usage. Regarding the first aspect, Hsu and Fingerman [ 74 ] stated that financial and non-financial incentives related to EV adoption should be expanded to “underserved communities” in order to increase EV adoption in California, USA. Regarding the second aspect, policies oriented to bundling EV and charging services can determine the adoption of EVs by Swiss consumers [ 49 ]. Apart from financial subsidies, obligative installation of charging infrastructure in new facilities, such as house and shopping malls, is important for EV adoption in Switzerland. Finally, referring to the third aspect, existing legislative limitations on car ownership and usage may be negative for EV adoption, as Zhuge et al. [ 82 ] concluded that the Chinese policy related to restrictions on the number of permits per household negatively affects the purchase of EVs. 4.3.6. Environmental Determinants Environmental concerns are presented as a crucial aspect for Indian consumers to adopt EVs [ 31 ]. Greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution and lack of recycling facilities for the lithium-ion EV batteries appear as determinants for the adoption of EVs in this study. However, according to another study for EV adoption in India [ 47 ], environmental concerns are not a determining parameter. Environmental concerns are a determining aspect for EV adoption in China in [ 68 ] and Switzerland [ 72 ], while they seem to influence the intention to adopt an EV in Spain in a less significant way [ 89 ]. Environmental concerns also affect the consumers’ intention to adopt an EV in Taiwan [ 54 ]. The environmentally sustainable performance of an EV can significantly contribute to the diffusion of EVs in Wuhan, China [ 43 ]. The perception of benefits for the environment associated with EV adoption emerges as the most important determinant for the intention to adopt an EV in Korea [ 62 ], while environmental awareness significantly affects the intention to adopt a hybrid EV in Malaysia [ 79 ]. Environmentally friendly consumer behavior constitutes an important aspect for EV adoption in the Nordic region [ 83 ]. The environmental impacts of EVs also constitute an important aspect associated with EV adoption in the UK [ 65 ]. 5. Discussion of Results and Policy Recommendations 5.1. Discussion of Results The current paper identifies the key determinants affecting the adoption of private, passenger electric vehicles by consumers through the detailed literature review on the most recent articles published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. The examined literature mainly covers case studies in a wide array of countries, while a variety of methods are being implemented. The key determinants affecting EV adoption are organized into six categories, following the political, economic, social and sociodemographic, technological and technical, legal and environmental factors of the PESTLE analysis ( Table 2 ). As it can be concluded from Table 2 , a multitude of determinants affect the attitude of consumers toward the adoption of electric vehicles. Overall, the majority of determinants reported by the literature refer to the comparison of infrastructure and vehicle performance between electric and ICEV, which affect EV attractiveness in terms of cost and quality of service. In order to elaborate on the results from the presentation of key determinants ( Section 4.3 ), further analysis was conducted to identify which of these determinants are highlighted as the ones of the highest importance regarding EV adoption by consumers. Then, the determinants of highest importance were categorized into the PESTLE categories, according to Table 2 . Figure 8 represents the share of papers that highlight a determinant of a specific PESTLE category as one of highest importance regarding EV adoption by consumers. As already discussed in Section 4.3 , there are papers that identify determinants of different PESTLE categories as the ones of highest importance. According to Figure 8 , a total of 45 of the reviewed papers highlight the political determinants as the most important ones toward EV adoption. More than half of the papers acknowledge the technological and technical determinants as the ones of highest importance, while over one third consider social and sociodemographic determinants as most important. The economic and the environmental determinants are highlighted as the ones of highest importance by 16 and 9 papers, respectively. The legal determinants are considered as determinants of the highest importance by only three papers. However, the political determinants cover policies for the promotion of electromobility that refer to other PESTLE categories, such as the provision of adequate technical infrastructure, namely charging infrastructure, the public awareness regarding the social and environmental benefits of EVs, the reduction of costs for the purchase and use of an EV, through subsidies, taxation policies etc., while they imply specific legislative concerns that should be addressed to ensure the effective implementation of these policies. Nonetheless, given the increasing environmental concerns of recent years, especially regarding climate change and renewable energy transition, and the social sensitivity related to sustainability issues, a higher significance of environmental determinants was expected as regards their influence on consumer EV adoption. However, the results of the review are not consistent with this hypothesis, as environmental concerns, in most cases, did not have a preponderant place among the factors affecting consumer adoption of EVs. 5.2. Policy Recommendations and Managerial Implications Charging infrastructure availability and fast charging are identified as important determinants for EV adoption. For this reason, the investment in public charging infrastructure, and especially in fast chargers, along with legislation associated with the obligation for charging infrastructure in new developments, are crucial policies in the framework of promoting EV adoption. Especially concerning fast charging infrastructure, the investment in fast chargers is expected to significantly contribute to the increase in EV adoption, given that the refueling time of an ICEV is much shorter than the recharging time of an EV, using conventional chargers. The ability and intention of consumers to use home charging should be taken into account for the development of appropriate policies for public charging infrastructure. The level of consumer awareness of EV advantages, especially as regards the environmental impact and the lower operation and maintenance cost of an EV compared to an ICEV, seems to play a significant role toward EV adoption. For this reason, information campaigns and relevant policies (e.g., test-driving) related to the increase in consumer familiarity with EVs and of their awareness of EV advantages are of high importance. Subsidies for EV purchase and tax reductions constitute the main determinants for EV adoption, while it is important for relevant policies to be appropriately and clearly communicated to all consumers. Furthermore, policies for bundling of EV purchase and renewable energy policies can be determining for EV adoption. Consumers value their choice depending on their personal image and attitude, mainly regarding innovation and environmental awareness, but also on the influence of their social environment. Age, gender, income, education level and commuting distance seem to also affect consumer adoption of EVs. For this reason, specific policies oriented to attracting target groups of different social and sociodemographic characteristics are necessary. In order to respond to the remaining technological and environmental barriers concerning EV adoption, research and development is needed for the technological advancement in terms of battery range and battery recycling in a safe and environmentally friendly way. For this reason, policies associated with relevant research and development projects are necessary. Finally, the current literature review highlights that there are differences among those consumers who already have an EV and those owning an ICEV, as well as among those who have had a driving experience with an EV. Furthermore, the key determinants for EV adoption may differ as to the type of EV engine technology, as mentioned in Section 2 . In some cases, differences were observed among the results of studies referring to the same geographical area. The above should be carefully considered in the process of developing and implementing effective policies toward EV adoption. 6. Conclusions and Future Research Directions The current paper provides a systematic and organized description of key determinants affecting the adoption of private, passenger electric vehicles by consumers, through the review of recent scientific literature. Based on these key determinants, main policy recommendations and implications are presented. As follow-up research, the methodological approach of the present literature review will be adjusted to the identification of key determinants in the adoption of other types of electromobility, such as public transport, shared cars, micro-mobility, freight and commercial vehicles, etc. A main conclusion from the specific research is that environmental determinants affect EV adoption less than initially expected, despite the increasing concerns about climate change and renewable energy transition. Nevertheless, one of the main determinants deriving from the literature review is the need for awareness campaigns that inform consumers about the environmental advantages of EVs. Finally, despite the fact that most of the determinants are common among different papers, there is no overall convergence as to which determinants are of the highest importance. Different significance is given to each determinant, depending on the methodological approach, the scope of the research, the study area and the targeted group of consumers. Thus, the development of a flexible methodological framework that will be able to assess the perception of end-users in relation to EV adoption in different contexts is proposed as a main direction for future research. This framework should also incorporate different types of electric vehicles and charging technologies, such as static or dynamic, inductive or conductive charging, etc. Funding This research received no external funding.

(I topped out @ 108-miles on an 80-degree day.) Good comfort for a 200#+ driver and three additional passengers w/luggage or groceries.Little change in maximum mileage over three-year lease period, even in sub-zero weather.

Did you? Yes No Show full review 5.0 Much Less Weird, Much More Cool Than I Thought! December 14, 2020 By Bewood from Washington, DC Owns this car Have owned my 2016 Kia Soul EV (Base) for 3 weeks now, and put a couple hundred miles on it.

It is the perfect car for commuting. 

I have a 16 mile round trip to and from work, and I’ve never had range anxiety or any problems whatsoever with this car. 

I also own a 2017 Kia Sedona EX minivan, and the infotainment features, climate control and
window/door buttons and procedures are very similar (mostly identical), and comparable. (Back up camera, heated seats, heated steering wheel, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto).

This is a well equipped car!  

While I have used the Soul EV primarily for commuting, I have also loaded up the family (wife, 3 kids) and  taken it around town, and it performed admirably. 

We fit 3 car seats in the back, and it was obviously a tighter fit than the Sedona, but the kids (5, 3, 1) had no complaints. 

For performance, I can’t say it’s very fast. Top speed is 90mph. 

But the old girl is QUICK! The 0-60 time isn’t impressive, but 0-30? You’re burning cats off the line! The instant torque you have available with an electric drivetrain is awesome for quick maneuvering in the city and on non interstate highways. Merging into traffic is NO problem. In fact, I feel better merging in with the Soul EV than a normal car.

One thing that is unique about the 2014-2016 Soul EV’s is that you can set the car to charge at home on a timer, and have it charge up to either 80% or 100%. The option to stop at 80% was removed for the 2017 and newer models due to some bizarre EPA rule. Many people want to stop at 80% regularly because it’s better for the long term health of the battery to only charge to 100% when that range is really needed. This makes the 2016 and older somewhat desirable for those who are concerned about battery life. It makes it quite simple to manage the battery in a healthy way. 

The 2016 being the newest with that option makes it particularly a good buy when you can find one. 

One thing to make clear about the battery life is that these cars all have a 10 year/100,000 mile EV system warranty, including the battery pack. 

This warranty transfers to each subsequent owner, and is effective from the day it’s sold to the first customer. 

When the battery reaches a state of health (SOH)  level below 70% of new, Kia will repair or replace it for free, under this warranty, regardless of number of owners, as long as you’re under 10/100k. 

For example, my 2016 wasn’t originally sold until Aug 2017. That means I have a full battery warranty till Aug 2027 or 100k miles. I’m at 19738 miles today. 

I think there are many of these types of situations sitting on lots today. 

Cars with lots of battery life and warranty left. At LOW prices. 

The 2014-2018 Souls have depreciated a lot since new, due primarily to one factor: 

The 2019-2020 and newer EV’s from Kia/Hyundai, Chevy, and others have more than doubled the range of these older ones. 

They are all above 200 and creeping up on 300 miles of electric range. That’s great! 

But if you don’t currently have 30-40k to spend on a new one, and don’t have a 70-80+ mile daily commute, then these 100 miler 2014-2018’s are a STEAL right now. 

They’re going as low as 10-12k in some cases at the moment, and may go even a bit lower. 

But many are low mileage, in excellent shape, have lots of battery life and warranty left. And they’re still well equipped like they are a $35k new vehicle -which they were in 2016. 

I’ll end by saying, I feel sad for my poor old gas Sedona. I just don’t feel like driving it anymore! We have her for the occasional large load or longer trip... but I have to say: 

I only go to the gas station for snacks and drinks these days! 

Owning an EV is WAY more cool and MUCH less weird and stressful than I thought it would be!

With the heavy battery underneath the car, it has a very stable ride and handles like a sports car which I also own.  The interior and amenities are excellent.

Did you? Yes No Show full review 3.0 Save your money for a better EV. January  3, 2020 By Joseph from Aurora, Colorado Owns this car I own one of these 2016 Kia Soul EV, I bought it with less than 5k miles on it and mine only has 6k miles on it currently and here are some of my issues with it.

Wouldn't recommend this car - Reason:
- The range really does suck, even if it is just 100 miles.  You WILL get some range anxiety at some point.
- Feels like the slowest accelerating EV ever made.
- Gets bad highway miles, this car needs a second gear for highway driving.
- Poor aerodynamics, due to boxy design and poorly designed front end.
- Battery goes dead fast unless you drive 50 MPH to 55 MPH, going over 65 is a quick way to drain your battery fast, and heat it up rapidly. (which damages it, KIA doesn't tell you this)
- There is absolutely no way to monitor battery temperature without using some paid phone app, and it is VERY important to be able to monitor your battery temperature.  
- Has a Thermal management system, with reasonable air cooling, but has no liquid cooling!
- The regenerative braking kinda sucks.
- Had a recall for a steering linkage issue.
- The car is comfortable until you hit a small bump in the road, as the top of your head smashes into the roof.
-You can never trust the GOM. (Shows the remaining estimated mileage left on the battery)  
-Loses 15% to 30% of its range in the cold weather.
-Battery gets very stressed if you charge with DC fast chargers and will rapidly lose its range, if you continue to use them or charge your vehicle past 80%.
-Backup camera could be better.

My advice?  Save your money.  There are so many new EVs coming out with more range, better battery management.  Don't waste your time with the 2014-2019 KIA Soul EV, the 2011 - 2018 Nissan Leaf.

Did you? Yes No Show full review 3.0 Charge on battery very misleading December 28, 2019 By Martha from Los angeles Owns this car I bought this car used 3 months ago and my biggest regret so far . my issue with the car is the battery keeps decreasing. When I first bought it a full charge was 78. Now a full charge gets me 65-67. I don’t know how much more it’s going to decrease and the dealership hasn’t been very helpful. “The battery passed the cell test” “the battery holds a full charge”.
I can’t go anywhere to far with out the worrying about charging somewhere . Using the heater right now really drops my range . limited on places to go within my current 65-67 mile range .
